<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t always the costume of women of
fashion ... or the blazing resplendent show-window
that tempts Little Lost Sisters.
It is more often just the human need for love
and shelter ... the lack of a friendly handclasp
that shall lighten tomorrow&#8217;s labor ... the sympathy
and understanding that breeds hope&#8221;

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
</div>

<p>They came up suddenly over a bit of
rising ground, the mill-owner and his
friend the writer and student of modern
industries, and stood in full view of the factory.
The air was sweet with scent of apple-blossoms.
A song sparrow trilled in the
poplar tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of our factory?&#8221; asked
the man of business and of success, turning his
keen, aggressive face towards his companion.
</p>
<p>The other, the dreamer, waited for moments
without speaking, carefully weighing the
word, then he answered,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow!&#8221; The owner&#8217;s voice
showed that he was really grieved. &#8220;Why
horrible?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mill is a crime against Nature. Look
how it violates that landscape. Look how it
stands there gaunt and tawdry against these
fresh green meadows edged round with billowy
white clouds that herald summer. And
you are proud of it. Could you not have found
some arid waste for this factory? Can&#8217;t you
see how Nature cries out against this outrage?
Can&#8217;t you see that she has dedicated this
country to seed-time and harvest,&mdash;these
verdant fields, deep woods and brooding
streams?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Millville people wanted our factory.
They paid us a subsidy to bring it here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blind, too!&#8221; The dreamer looked backward
at the town. &#8220;They tell me that the
founders there called their village Farmington.
Have you ever reflected what a change
you are working in the lives of these people
by substituting industrialism for agriculture?
Have you thought of the moral transformations
such a substitution must work among
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not responsible for their morals,&#8221;
the mill-owner answered, impatiently. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
have spared nothing to make our factory up
to date. The mill meets all the demands of
modern hygiene and sanitation. We do that
for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His friend was silent for a time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your employes here are chiefly women,
very young women,&#8221; he said at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have two hundred girls,&#8221; replied
the mill-owner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your highest wage for a girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight dollars a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the younger man was silent. Then
he took his friend&#8217;s arm within his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These girls are the mothers of tomorrow.
To an extent the destinies of our race depend
upon them. Your factory places upon you
tremendous responsibilities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are growing to realize our responsibilities
more and more,&#8221; said the man of business
and of success gravely. &#8220;Perhaps we do
not realize them keenly enough. It is the
fault of the times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is the fault of the times. Life,
honor, virtue itself trampled down in the rush
for the dollar.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that a change is coming, though
slowly. I believe that the day will come when
we owners of mills will regard it as a disgraceful
thing for our corporations to declare a
dividend while notoriously underpaying our
employes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and perhaps the day is coming, too,
when the employer who maintains conditions
in his mills that subtly undermine the virtue
of his women workers will be regarded as a
public enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, but that time is a long way
ahead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must look to the future,&#8221; said his
friend. &#8220;We must work for the future, too!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT THE BUTTON MILL</h3>
</div>

<p>Elsie Welcome was the one girl in
the big machine room of the Millville
button factory who did not rise when the bell
sounded for the short afternoon recess. She
swung on her revolving stool away from her
machine and looked eagerly, thirstingly towards
the windows where the other girls were
crowding for breath of the fresh June air, but
she did not stir to follow them. A resolution
stronger than her own keen need of the recreation
moments was singling out this young girl
from among her two hundred companions,
laughing and talking together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak to Mr. Kemble now&mdash;now,&#8221;
she promised herself, watching for the foreman
to enter the machine room, according to
his daily custom at this hour. Elsie nerved
herself to a task difficult to perform, even after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
her three years of work in the factory, even
though she was one of the most skilful workers
here.
</p>
<p>She drew up her charmingly modeled little
figure tensely, and held her small head high,
her pure, beautiful features aglow with delicate
color, her slender, shapely hands clasping
and unclasping each other.
</p>
<p>The foreman came into the room. Elsie
rose from her place and went to meet him,
pushing back the pretty tendrils of her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kemble,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I should like to
speak to you a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hiram Kemble was a tall, thin young man,
deeply conscious of his own importance and
responsibilities. He had risen by assiduous
devotion to the details of button making from
office boy to his present exalted state. His
mind had become a mere filing cabinet for
information concerning the button business.
</p>
<p>He stood regarding the girl before him,
feeling the attraction of her beauty and resenting
it. He did not dislike her; he did not
understand her, and it was his nature to distrust
what he did not understand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with professional brusqueness,
&#8220;what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to ask you to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221; Elsie hesitated,
then went on with courage, &#8220;to raise my
wages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her in amazement, displeased.
&#8220;How much are you getting now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only eight dollars a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only!&#8221; Hiram Kemble was satirical.
&#8220;That&#8217;s as much as the others are getting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. But it&#8217;s not enough. Our
expenses are heavy. My mother has begun
to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221; Elsie choked. &#8220;My mother is compelled
to take in washing. She&#8217;s not strong
enough for such heavy work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sister has a good job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She earns only nine dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears sprang to Elsie&#8217;s eyes, but she would
not let them fall. &#8220;He&#8217;s not earning anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; Kemble spoke accusingly. &#8220;He
is drinking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie showed a flash of spirit: &#8220;That&#8217;s not
my fault!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. But you can&#8217;t hold the Millville
Button Company responsible for your father&#8217;s
misbehavior.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any chance for me to get more
pay?&#8221; There was a note of despair in her
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the least chance in the world. You
are getting our maximum wage for women. I
couldn&#8217;t raise your pay if I wanted to without
being specially authorized to do so by our
board of directors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can never earn&mdash;never get any
more here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minute hand of the electric clock pushed
forward. Again a bell sounded. Two hundred
American girls who had had a few
moments&#8217; respite came trooping wearily back
to their places at the machines.
</p>
<p>At the clang of the bell Kemble walked up
the room. Elsie went back to her place drooping;
she wore a beaten air as if he had struck
her visibly.
</p>
<p>The girls on either hand spoke to her as
they slipped into their places, but she did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
hear them. Hours of swift work followed.
The machines whirred and the deft hands of
the girls flew. These button workers had
nearly all been recruited from the district
around Millville. With rare exceptions they
were descendants of the hardy Americans
who had founded the town while it was still
called Farmington. The founders had passed
away. The outside world had pressed around
the village until its people longed to play a
more active role in the world. It had seemed
a great day when the button factory came, and
the town name was changed to Millville.
</p>
<p>Now these daughters of the strong elder
race were factory workers. The world had
been made better by an output of thousands of
shiny new buttons when at last the six o&#8217;clock
whistle blew on this bright June day.
</p>
<p>Elsie Welcome got up from her machine
and picked up her hat listlessly. She walked
to a window and looked out. Suddenly animation
came into her face. A young man waved
a handkerchief from an automobile which
spun by on the gray turnpike below the mill.
Elsie waved her handkerchief in return.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Kemble, watching the girl from across the
room, saw the episode. He hurried across to
her, with the air of pouncing on a victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have none of that here, Miss Welcome,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If you have to flirt, don&#8217;t
flirt on the company&#8217;s premises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned upon him indignantly. &#8220;I am
not flirting! That gentleman is a friend of
mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kemble sneered. &#8220;Oh, he is a friend, is he?
Where does a factory girl like you meet men
who ride in automobiles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie flushed scarlet; she bit her quivering
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashamed to tell where you met him, are
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I&#8217;m responsible to my employers
for the character of the girls I employ here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie looked her contempt of him. She
laughed a little low scornful laugh which made
Kemble thoroughly angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
know when you&#8217;re well off. You are too independent.&#8221;
His tone of anger roused her temper,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
but she held herself in leash and answered
with cold politeness:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kemble, when I feel myself getting
independent, the first thing I shall do will be
to get away from the Millville button factory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kemble was ready to retreat now. The
interview was getting beyond his expectation.
Elsie was one of the company&#8217;s fastest
workers. He could not afford to have her
throw up her place. He did not want to lose
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you like the factory, Miss Welcome,&#8221;
he said in a suddenly pacific tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like&mdash;the&mdash;factory! I hate it,&#8221; returned
the girl, all her pent-up wrongs finding expression.
&#8220;I hate the mill and everything
about it. Do you suppose any girl could like
the prospect of being bottled up in this hole
year after year for eight dollars a week?
Why, some day, Mr. Kemble, I expect to pay
eight dollars for a hat, for just one hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Kemble, &#8220;fine feathers,
eh? I know, you&#8217;re like a lot of other girls
who have come and gone in this factory.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
You&#8217;ve heard of Chicago&#8217;s bright lights and
you want to singe your wings in them. Let
me tell you something, my girl, girls in your
position don&#8217;t get eight dollar hats without
paying for them and if they haven&#8217;t got the
money they give something else. They
give&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; ordered the girl. &#8220;You shan&#8217;t say
that to me. I don&#8217;t believe it. You can&#8217;t convince
me that there isn&#8217;t something better in
life for a girl like me than Millville and eight
dollars a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I pity your ignorance,&#8221; said Kemble,
loftily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not ignorance to want something better
than this,&#8221; replied Elsie. &#8220;Why should
you taunt me with ignorance, anyway? What
do you know about the world? You&#8217;re just a
foreman in a little country mill and because
you are satisfied with a narrow little life like
that you think everyone else ought to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The truth in this goaded Kemble into violation
of rule number twelve for button factory
foremen which exhorts such employes to be
polite to women workers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why the devil don&#8217;t you go to Chicago and
be done with it then?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;You&#8217;re
one of these people that has to learn by experience.&#8221;
He sneered at her. &#8220;Perhaps you can
get your friend in the auto to take you. Why
don&#8217;t you try it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears rushed to the girl&#8217;s eyes. She began
fastening on her hat to conceal her emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Chicago,&#8221; she muttered,
&#8220;just as soon as I am able. Nothing there can
be much worse than being compelled to work
in Millville under you. Good gracious,&#8221; she
added maliciously, after giving him a thorough
inspection, &#8220;it&#8217;s no use to stand here
arguing with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this taunt Miss Elsie gave her hat a
final adjustment, then, leaving Mr. Hiram
Kemble speechless with rage and injured dignity,
she walked out of the factory door.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SEEING MILLVILLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The distance from the Millville button
factory to the corner of Main and Pine
streets in Millville itself is, if you take the
short cut through Nutting&#8217;s Grove, as all sensible
Millvillians do, a five minutes&#8217; walk. If
the reader, touring Millville in search of the
beginnings of this story, will make that journey
in his imagination he will find himself
standing on the rough board walk in front of
John Price&#8217;s general store.
</p>
<p>From her eminence on the top of one of
Mr. John Price&#8217;s high stools Patience Welcome
glanced up from the ledger over which
she was toiling, put the blunt end of her pen
into her mouth and looked out into the street
drenched in sunshine. A half dozen farmers&#8217;
horses, moored to the hitching rack in front of
the store, threshed restlessly with their tails
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
at enthusiastic banqueting flies, newborn into
a world that seemed to be filled with juicy
horses.
</p>
<p>The scene did not interest Patience. Her
glance went on across the street where an overdressed
young man, just alighted from an
automobile, stood surveying his surroundings.
His eyes met hers. He removed his hat with
an elaborate bow. The girl, a little piqued and
a little amused, reached over very quietly and
drew down the window curtain. Then she
resumed operations on the ledger with the
sharp end of the pen.
</p>
<p>Patience Welcome, like her sister, was dark
of hair and eyes. Her hair, too, had the quality
of forming into tendrils about her cheeks
which glowed with a happy, if not a robust,
healthfulness. But there the resemblance
ended. The two girls were widely different
personalities. Elsie, the younger, was impetuous
by nature, imaginative, and easily
swept off her mental balance by her emotions.
She was ambitious, too, and Millville did not
please her. Patience, no less imaginative,
perhaps, possessed a stronger hold upon herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
She admired her daring sister, but she
was sensible of the dangers of such daring and
did not imitate her. She possessed the great
gift of contentedness. It colored all her
thoughts, created pleasant places for her in
what, to Elsie, seemed a desolate life; it made
Millville not only a bearable but even a happy
place to live in. Millville understood Patience
and loved her; Elsie, being less understandable,
was less popular.
</p>
<p>It had been a busy day in John Price&#8217;s store
and Patience was entering in her books items
from a pile of bills on the desk before her. It
was five minutes after her usual leaving time,
but the girl accepted extra duty with a cheerfulness
that was part of her nature.
</p>
<p>In the midst of her work there was a bustle
at the back of the store. John Price, local
merchant prince and owner of this establishment,
had returned from the yard at the rear
of the store where he had been superintending
the storing of goods, arrived on the late afternoon
train. He was a wiry little old man of
sixty, abrupt, nervous, irritable and given to
sharpness of speech which, he was profoundly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
convinced, hid from outside perception a heart
given to unbusinesslike tenderness. He busied
himself noisily about the shelves for a few
minutes, then suddenly stuck his head through
the door of the little office in which Patience
was working.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you here? Get out.
Go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be through in a few minutes,&#8221; rejoined
Patience, without taking her eyes from her
figures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tush,&#8221; said Mr. Price. &#8220;What are you
trying to do, give me a bad name with my
trade? People will think I&#8217;m a slave driver.
Get out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In just a minute,&#8221; smiled Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go home, I say,&#8221; almost shouted Price.
He took off his alpaca coat and hung it on a
nail. Then he stepped up suddenly behind
Patience, took the pen deliberately from her
hand and pushed her off the stool.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I throw you out?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Must I? Must I, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pointed towards the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Price,&#8221; said Patience submissively,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
gathering up her bills and thrusting
them into a drawer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry,&#8221; said Price. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be late for
your supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Patience, putting
on her jacket and hat. &#8220;This is wash day at
our house. Supper is always late on wash
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wash day, eh? Then you ought to be
home helping your mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie will help mother,&#8221; replied Patience
quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure about that?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Price.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m sure, Mr. Price,&#8221; said
Patience, hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Price, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure.
But don&#8217;t stand here arguing. I haven&#8217;t any
time to argue with a snip of a girl like you.
Get out. Go home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience, still a little hurt by her employer&#8217;s
expressed doubt about her sister, started for
the front door. Looking out, she saw the
overdressed young man with the automobile
still standing across the street. He saw her,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
too, and waved his cigarette. Patience turned
back into the store.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl,&#8221; demanded Mr. Price, his patience
now seemingly exhausted, &#8220;where in the devil
are you going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out the back way, if you please, Mr.
Price.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Price got up deliberately from the stool
which he had occupied as soon as Patience had
vacated it and looked out of the front door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The young whelp,&#8221; he said, apostrophizing
the overdressed youth with the cigarette.
Then to Patience: &#8220;Dodging him, eh? Now
don&#8217;t blush, girl. I don&#8217;t blame him for looking
at you. You&#8217;re worth looking at. But
you show mighty good sense in keeping away
from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Price, I&mdash;&#8221; Patience stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, that&#8217;s all right, dodge him, keep him
guessing. One of those freshies from the city,
eh? Well, there&#8217;s mighty little good in &#8217;em.
Give your ma my best regards. Tell her she&#8217;s
got a fine daughter. Good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience left the store by the rear door and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
started briskly for her home. She had gone
but a block when she heard a wagon rumbling
behind her and a voice called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, there, Patience, late, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Harvey Spencer, ambitious &#8220;all
round&#8221; clerk, hostler, collector for Millville&#8217;s
leading grocer. He drove a roan colt which
went rather skittishly. There was an older
man in the wagon with him. Harvey drew up
the colt beside Patience with a vociferous
&#8220;Whoa.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Patience, &#8220;I&#8217;m a little late.
Lots of business these days, Harvey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;Millville is flourishing.
We&#8217;ll soon have a real city here. Oh,
Miss Welcome, let me make you acquainted
with my friend, Mr. Michael Grogan of
Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience accepted the introduction with
flushed reserve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right glad to know you,&#8221; stated Mr.
Grogan, removing his hat gallantly and
wiping a perspiring brow with his handkerchief.
&#8220;But let me tell you I don&#8217;t think much
of your friend, Harvey Spencer. Sure, I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
been riding with him for two hours and you&#8217;re
the first pleasant object he&#8217;s shown me. And
such a ride! It&#8217;s a certainty that this young
fellow knows every bump and thank-ye-ma&#8217;am
in the village and he&#8217;s taken me full
speed over all of them. I feel like I&#8217;d been
churned. But I&#8217;ll forgive him all that now&mdash;now
that he&#8217;s shown me you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sincerity in Mr. Grogan&#8217;s
raillery that swept away Patience&#8217;s reserve.
Besides, he was over fifty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; she said, slyly imitating Mr.
Grogan&#8217;s brogue, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been kissing the
blarney stone, Mr. Grogan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will ye listen to that now?&#8221; said Grogan
enthusiastically, as he started to clamber off
the wagon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit still, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; said Harvey,
laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you hear her, man alive? Sure,
she&#8217;s Irish&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; put in Patience, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
heard of the blarney stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that, now,&#8221; said Grogan, returning
to his seat with an air of keen disappointment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&#8220;And I was just longin&#8217; to see someone
from the Ould Sod. I thought&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like riding with Harvey?&#8221; inquired
Patience, changing the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grogan plaintively, &#8220;if I were
twenty years younger maybe it would be good
exercise, but with my years, Miss, &#8217;tis just
plain exhausting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here Harvey started the roan colt off
again. &#8220;See you later,&#8221; he called back to
Patience, &#8220;I&#8217;m stopping at your house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s Tom Welcome&#8217;s daughter, is it?&#8221;
said Grogan as they got out of hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of them,&#8221; said Harvey, &#8220;but
you ought to see the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man now,&#8221; went on Grogan, &#8220;is a
good deal of a lush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls can&#8217;t help what their father is,&#8221;
retorted Harvey, bridling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; went on Mr. Grogan.
&#8220;Such things happen in the best of families.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and you can&#8217;t blame Tom Welcome
much, either,&#8221; went on Harvey. &#8220;He was
drove to drink. He invented an electrical
machine that would have made a fortune for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
him and some one stole it from him. It wasn&#8217;t
the loss of the money that sent him to the
devil, either. He&#8217;d spent a lifetime on his
machine and just when he was getting it
patented, some smart thief in Chicago takes it
away from him. That&#8217;s what I call tough
luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hard up, you say?&#8221; pursued
Grogan.
</p>
<p>Harvey, unconscious that he had said
nothing of the sort, admitted that the Welcomes
were in financial straits. &#8220;Their mother
has to take in washing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and both the
girls work. It&#8217;s too bad, for they ought to
be getting an education.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The roan colt came to an abrupt stop. They
were in front of a small cottage. Grogan surveyed
the place for a moment and then turned
to his jehu. &#8220;And what might you be stopping
here for?&#8221; he inquired.
</p>
<p>Harvey paused with one foot on the step of
the wagon and looked up at Grogan gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Tom Welcome&#8217;s cottage,&#8221; he said.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>ENTER A DETECTIVE</h3>
</div>

<p>While Harvey Spencer was climbing
down from his wagon Mr. Michael
Grogan, who was not exactly the guileless
soul Millville took him to be, permitted himself
rather a close inspection of the Welcome
premises. There was nothing imposing about
them. The cottage was old and obviously in
need of repair. The fence which surrounded
it had been repaired in places, apparently by
someone who had small interest in the job.
The little patch of ground in front, however,
was decorated with a neatly kept vegetable
garden bordered with flowers. The stone step
at the cottage entrance was immaculate. Mr.
Grogan was shrewd enough to indulge himself
in the speculation that whatever Tom
Welcome might be his wife was a careful
housekeeper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome was standing in her open
door and Grogan studied her with a curiosity
not entirely disinterested. Her figure was
frail and slightly bowed. Her hair, as it
showed in the deepening dusk was almost
white. Her features had delicacy like those
of the daughter Grogan had just met. She
was wiping her hands on a gingham apron.
They were hands of a hard working woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mrs. Welcome, nice day, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
called Harvey as he came through the gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is nice, isn&#8217;t it, Harvey?&#8221; replied
Martha Welcome. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t noticed it before,
I&#8217;ve been so busy with the washing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s voice, Mr. Grogan noted, held
a note of sadness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said Harvey, dropping his
voice and speaking with the assurance of an
old family friend, &#8220;that if I had two girls like
your Elsie and Patience, I&#8217;d see that they
helped out with the washing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can they help me?&#8221; replied Mrs.
Welcome. &#8220;Patience is up early every morning
and off to Mr. Price&#8217;s store and Elsie is
at the mill all day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Harvey, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think,
but surely they might&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they help a lot,&#8221; broke in Mrs. Welcome,
hurriedly. &#8220;They do all their ironing
at night. And that&#8217;s all anyone could ask of
them after they come home tired from their
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear it. Your two girls
always do look nice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Harvey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Welcome&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Harvey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think&mdash;&#8221; Harvey stopped and
looked about hesitatingly,&mdash;&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t you
think it would be just as well if Elsie didn&#8217;t
see quite as much of this Chicago fellow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean Mr. Druce?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. Of course, he&#8217;s all right&mdash;&#8221; Harvey
again hesitated and puckered his lips thoughtfully.
&#8220;He wears fine clothing, patent leather
shoes, sports a diamond ring, but it seems to
me Elsie&#8217;s different somehow since that
Martin Druce began to hang around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome laughed softly. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
a glint of humor in her eyes. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re
jealous, aren&#8217;t you, Harvey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say I am,&#8221; agreed Harvey. &#8220;Never
mind that. Is it a good thing for Elsie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie&#8217;s a good girl,&#8221; replied Mrs. Welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She sure is, Mrs. Welcome. That&#8217;s why I
want her to be Mrs. Harvey Spencer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome opened her eyes wide at this
statement and looked kindly at the stout
young man before her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean it, Harvey?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so much in earnest,&#8221; he replied,
fumbling in his pocket, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve got the ring
right here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He produced a plain gold wedding ring
nestling in a white velvet case. Mrs. Welcome
uttered a little cry of gladness. She believed
in Harvey, who, incidentally, was all he pretended
to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I know I ain&#8217;t much,&#8221; went on Harvey,
&#8220;just a clerk in a small town store, but I&#8217;ve
got ambitions. Look at all the great men!
Where did they begin? At the bottom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey paused. Then he looked all about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
him carefully and, satisfied with this survey,
leaned confidentially toward Mrs. Welcome
and whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, can you keep a secret, Mrs. Welcome?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; replied Mrs. Welcome smiling.
&#8220;Try me, Harvey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m going to be a detective,&#8221;
Harvey announced proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are, Harvey?&#8221; was the astonished
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just watch me,&#8221; Harvey went on. &#8220;I&#8217;m
taking a correspondence school course. Here
are some of my lessons.&#8221; He took some
closely typewritten sheets of paper from his
pocket. &#8220;Ever notice how broad I am between
the eyes?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I have,&#8221; said Mrs. Welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am, and it&#8217;s one of the signs, so
they say, of the born detective. Listen here
a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He unfolded the bulky pages and read
grandly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Always be observant of even the smallest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
trifles. A speck of dust may be an important
clew to a murder.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvey!&#8221; cried Mrs. Welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, Mrs. Welcome, just
wanted to show you that I mean business.&#8221;
Harvey paused for a moment and regarded
her steadily. Then he pointed his finger at
her accusingly as he said: &#8220;I knew you were
washing before you told me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, Harvey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, because you had suds on your apron
where you dried your hands.&#8221; He drew a
deep sigh and threw out his chest. &#8220;There,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;m bad at these lessons,
eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good boy, Harvey,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Welcome, indulgently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; He bowed. &#8220;Oh, perhaps
my future mother-in-law and I aren&#8217;t going
to get along fine,&#8221; he announced to the world
in general, exultingly.
</p>
<p>The roan colt interrupted this rhapsody by
pawing impatiently at the ground. Harvey
took his order book from his pocket and stuck
his stub of lead pencil in his mouth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;how about orders,
Mrs. Welcome?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we&mdash;need some flour,&#8221; was the hesitating
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A barrel?&#8221; suggested Harvey, turning to
a fresh page of his order book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;I guess ten pounds, and&mdash;I
guess that&#8217;s about all, Harvey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ll excuse me if I doubt your
word, Mrs. Welcome,&#8221; said Harvey, writing
down fifty pounds of flour quickly. &#8220;Come
now, tell me what you do really want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, what&#8217;s the use. We need everything,
we&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Welcome broke down and began
to weep softly as she turned toward the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hold on, Mrs. Welcome, don&#8217;t break
away from me like that!&#8221; Harvey followed
her and laid his hand gently on her arm. &#8220;I
hope Mr. Welcome isn&#8217;t drinking again.
Is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so, Harvey.&#8221; Mrs. Welcome&#8217;s
frail shoulders quivered as she attempted to
restrain her sobs. &#8220;Why, Tom hasn&#8217;t been
home for two days and&mdash;and our rent is due&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Harvey Spencer interrupted with a prolonged
whistle which seemed to be the best
way he could think of expressing sympathy.
A light dawned on him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why young Harry Boland is here
from Chicago, to collect the rent, eh?&#8221; he
inquired.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome nodded assent, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;Mr. Boland has been very kind. He
has waited two weeks and&mdash;and&mdash;we can&#8217;t
pay him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not let me&mdash;&#8221; suggested Harvey,
putting his hand into his pocket. Mrs. Welcome
checked him with a quick movement.
&#8220;No, Harvey, please. I don&#8217;t want you to do
that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t feel right about
it somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say, Mrs. Welcome.&#8221; Harvey
was rather diffident and hesitated to press a
loan on her. To change the subject he said:
&#8220;Young Mr. Boland seems taken up with
Patience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t noticed it,&#8221; said Mrs. Welcome,
drying her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, we detectives have to keep our eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
open,&#8221; acclaimed Harvey with another burst
of pride.
</p>
<p>But here Michael Grogan interrupted.
&#8220;Young man,&#8221; he called out from the roadway,
&#8220;are you really taking orders or is this
one of your visiting days?&#8221; He tied the colt
and came into the yard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Harvey, &#8220;getting tired of
waiting?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I felt myself growing to that hitching
post,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;so I tied that bunch
of nerves you have out there and moved before
I took root.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey laughed and turned to Mrs. Welcome.
&#8220;This is Mr. Michael Grogan, Mrs.
Welcome,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome backed away toward the
porch, removing her apron. &#8220;Good afternoon,
sir,&#8221; she greeted him. &#8220;I hope you are well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;I was before this
young marauder cajoled me into leaving me
arm chair on the hotel veranda to go bumping
over these roads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome smiled and extended her
hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to know you, Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Grogan. You mustn&#8217;t mind Harvey&#8217;s impetuous
ways. He&#8217;s all right here.&#8221; She placed
her hand on her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go bail he is that if you say so, Mrs.
Welcome,&#8221; replied Grogan gallantly, &#8220;anyhow
I&#8217;ll take him on your word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just ready to go, Mr. Grogan, when you
called,&#8221; put in Harvey. Then he caught Mrs.
Welcome by the arm and bustled her into the
house, saying: &#8220;And I&#8217;ll see that you get all
of those things, Mrs. Welcome, flour, corn
meal, tomatoes, beans, lard&mdash;&#8221; and in spite of
her protestations he closed the door on her
with a parting: &#8220;Everything on the first delivery
tomorrow morning sure.&#8221; Then he added
to Grogan, who stood smiling with a look of
comprehension on his face, &#8220;All right. Ready
to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time,&#8221; commented Grogan as
they went toward the wagon. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m too inquisitive if I ask who are these Welcomes
anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are having a tough time,&#8221; replied
Harvey, unhitching his colt. &#8220;Tom Welcome
used to be quite a man. He had that invention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
I was telling you about, an electric
lamp. He was done out of it and went to the
booze for consolation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; murmured Grogan, half to himself,
&#8220;Two girls in the family, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was one of them you met just
before we came here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pretty one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and they&#8217;re the best ever,&#8221; added
Harvey, antagonized by something he sensed
in his companion&#8217;s manner.
</p>
<p>Grogan turned to him smiling. &#8220;There,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t get hot about it. Nobody
doubts that, meself least of all. Ain&#8217;t I Irish?
It&#8217;s the first article of every Irishman&#8217;s creed
to believe that all women, old or young, pretty
or otherwise, all of them are just&mdash;good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey seized the older man&#8217;s hand and
shook it vigorously. Then looking up the road
he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Elsie Welcome, I think. I
want you to meet her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; retorted Grogan. He turned and
looked at Elsie closely. She ran rapidly down
the pathway toward the gate. She saw them,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
paused, walked more slowly and came up to
them apparently in confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello Harv! What are you doing
here so late?&#8221; she asked. Without waiting for
a reply she started toward the gate flinging
back a short &#8220;Good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s whole manner indicated a guilty
conscience. It was evident that she did not
wish to talk to Harvey Spencer. She passed
through the gate toward the door of her home.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>HARVEY MEETS &#8220;A DEALER IN CATTLE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Harvey threw the reins into Grogan&#8217;s
lap and strode recklessly after Elsie.
His good-natured face was flushed with
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, unwilling, halted. &#8220;Nothing,&#8221;
she replied, &#8220;what makes you ask that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; explained Harvey, hiding his anger
and attempting to take her hand, &#8220;you&#8217;re out
of breath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been running,&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s laconic
explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t usually run home from the mill,
Elsie,&#8221; Harvey&#8217;s detective instinct was showing
itself.
</p>
<p>Elsie was extremely irritated by this unwished
for interview.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&mdash;&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;I wanted to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
get here because it&#8217;s Monday and mother&#8217;s
washing day and&mdash;&#8221; She paused, her irritation
getting the better of her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
what right you have to question me, Harvey
Spencer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan had got down from the wagon and
at this moment came through the gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; he began, addressing Spencer.
The girl interrupted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Do you
come from the mill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from no mill,&#8221; retorted Grogan,
piqued by the girl&#8217;s tone, &#8220;and if you&#8217;ll excuse
me I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Michael Grogan of Chicago,&#8221;
put in Harvey placatingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been showing
him the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; added Grogan quickly, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
seen much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not at all strange,&#8221; said Elsie,
&#8220;because there&#8217;s nothing to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And in Chicago, where I come from,&#8221; said
Grogan sagely, &#8220;there&#8217;s altogether too much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan saw by his two companions&#8217; faces
that he was an intruder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
wait for you. I&#8217;ve some letters to write at the
hotel. I think I&#8217;ll be strolling along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Harvey, hospitable in the face
of intrusion, &#8220;you&#8217;re welcome to ride. Won&#8217;t
you wait?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;that grocery
wagon of yours wasn&#8217;t built to accommodate
a man of my size.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey and the girl watched Grogan disappear
in the dusk. Then the young man
turned to the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie&mdash;&#8221; he began tenderly.
</p>
<p>But the girl stopped him. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t
begin to question me,&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are trying to hide something from
me,&#8221; said Harvey, grasping the girl&#8217;s unwilling
hand. The girl drew away from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
you to bother me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never used to bother you,&#8221; said Harvey,
his face flushing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was before&mdash;&#8221; began Elsie impulsively.
&#8220;I mean now,&#8221; she went on, catching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
herself. &#8220;I mean that you do now because
you have changed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; contradicted Harvey, &#8220;but you have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; challenged
the girl.
</p>
<p>Harvey stood silent for a moment and
jerked out a laugh of embarrassment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know exactly what I mean,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you
know we were engaged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie flushed. &#8220;We were not,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Harvey miserably stumbling
on, &#8220;we sort of were. We understood.&#8221; He
brought one hand from his pocket. It held the
box containing the ring. &#8220;Why, Elsie,&#8221; he
said pleadingly, &#8220;I even bought the ring.
Just a plain band of gold. I did so hope that
some day, soon perhaps, you&#8217;d let me put it on
your finger and take you to our home. It
wouldn&#8217;t be much, but I&#8217;d love you and care
for you. Why I&#8217;d work night and day just to
make things easy for you. I love you. It all
begins and ends with that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie stood for a moment as though this
honest appeal had touched her. Then she
turned sharply.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;O, what&#8217;s the use,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Look at
this place. See how we live. And you&mdash;you
want me to go on like this? No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey stared at her stupidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stare at me like that,&#8221; said the girl
annoyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am wondering what has changed you
so,&#8221; said Harvey apologetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is something, or somebody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Harvey, please don&#8217;t begin&mdash;&#8221; Elsie
paused. Her glance left Harvey&#8217;s face. A
young man in a brown tweed suit and carrying
a light walking stick in his gloved hand was
coming toward the gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said easily, addressing Elsie and
ignoring Spencer, &#8220;anybody at home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie turned toward him with impulsive
friendliness, then remembering her other suitor
paused and tried to assume a manner of
unconcern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there&#8217;s someone at home,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;can&#8217;t you see there is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be sure that such loveliness is real,&#8221;
said the newcomer gallantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking Chicagoese,&#8221; said the girl,
not, however, displeased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple fact, believe me,&#8221; was the assured
response.
</p>
<p>Elsie saw that Harvey was eyeing the
stranger with hostility. &#8220;Do you know Mr.
Spencer, Mr. Druce?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody in Millville knows Mr.
Spencer,&#8221; replied Martin Druce, putting out
his hand. &#8220;He&#8217;s a town institution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Harvey, mollified by
what he thought a sincere compliment and
shaking hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Institution!&#8221; laughed Elsie.
</p>
<p>Harvey stopped and withdrew the hand. It
dawned on him that there was a secret understanding
between Druce and the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hold on,&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Just what do
you mean by that word &#8216;institution?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you&#8217;re one of the landmarks here,&#8221;
explained Druce, &#8220;the same as the bank or the
opera house.&#8221; He brushed the lapel of
Harvey&#8217;s coat with his gloved hand and
straightened his collar. Then he soberly removed
Harvey&#8217;s straw hat, fingered it into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
grotesque lines and replaced it on his head.
He stepped back to observe the effect, adding
satirically: &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you won&#8217;t stay long in
this jay town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dead right there,&#8221; boasted Harvey.
&#8220;Millville is all right and a rising place but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; said Druce gravely. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be coming up to Chicago to show Marshall
Field how to run his store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I may&mdash;&#8221; began Harvey proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Elsie&#8217;s voice was pained. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
do that, Mr. Druce!&#8221; Then she turned to
Spencer. &#8220;Why do you let him make a joke
of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Me?&#8221; Harvey looked at her in
astonishment. He turned to Druce savagely.
&#8220;Say,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;are you trying to kid
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I knew
better than to try to kid a wise young man
like you. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that
you&#8217;re too big for this town. Say, what&#8217;s
your ambition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got one, Mr. Druce. I&#8217;m going
to be a detective.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s lots of room for a real one
in Chicago,&#8221; said Druce, suppressing a contemptuous
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may go there some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;the more the
merrier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Druce,&#8221; asked Harvey, now completely
taken in by the ingratiating stranger,
&#8220;what&#8217;s your business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine, why&mdash;&#8221; The man moved toward
Elsie as he spoke, gazing at her steadily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve got one, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; persisted
Harvey.
</p>
<p>Druce seemed confused for a moment.
Then his face broke into a genial smile. Both
Elsie and Spencer were watching him
curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ve got a business. It&#8217;s a mighty
profitable one, too. I&#8217;m a dealer in live stock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cattle?&#8221; said Harvey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got me,&#8221; was the casual response,
&#8220;just cattle.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A SERPENT WHISPERS AND A WOMAN LISTENS</h3>
</div>

<p>The word cattle seemed to arouse the
roan colt to his own existence. He
whinnied ingratiatingly and tugged at his
hitching strap. Whether or not his master had
forgotten, he knew it was supper time.
Harvey heard him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said to Druce, backing away
towards the gate. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to be going. Drop
into the store some time. I&#8217;ll give you a
cigar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; laughed Druce. Then under his
breath he added, &#8220;Like blazes I will.&#8221; He
turned back to Elsie. &#8220;Is that the Rube,&#8221;
he demanded, &#8220;who wants to marry you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; defended Elsie hotly, &#8220;and he&#8217;s all
right, too. I don&#8217;t think it was nice of you to
make fun of him as you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; said Druce soothingly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me. I was just playing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
around.&#8221; He paused and looked warily
at the house. &#8220;Everything all right, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so,&#8221; replied Elsie, with an
anxious look in the same direction. &#8220;Harvey
frightened me when I first got home. For a
moment I thought he knew that I had been
out with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what if he did? There&#8217;s no harm in
going for a ride with me, is there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o,&#8221; Elsie shook her head doubtfully.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t feel just right about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that grocery fellow didn&#8217;t know after
all, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. At least he said nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce shrugged his shoulders derisively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. At least he said nothing.&#8221;
he couldn&#8217;t detect a hair in the butter. I&#8217;m
not worried about him. How is it with your
own folks? Your mother doesn&#8217;t know?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='color:gray; font-size:smaller;'>[Transcriber&#8127;s note: previous paragraph transcribed as printed,
with apparent obfuscation by duplicated line.]
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Elsie, uneasy again. &#8220;Anyway,
mother wouldn&#8217;t matter so much, but
dad&mdash;&#8221; She covered her face with her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Druce tenderly, drawing
her toward him and caressing her. &#8220;We
had some ride, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Grand,&#8221; replied Elsie, brightened by the
recollection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you it would be all right if I hired
the car and picked you up around the corner
from the mill. Say&mdash;&#8221; The man lowered his
tone. &#8220;Gee, you&#8217;re prettier than ever today,
Elsie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Something in his manner caused the girl to
recoil. The shrinking movement did not
escape Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, girlie?&#8221; he inquired.
&#8220;Do you know that in all the weeks I have been
coming down here from Chicago to see you,
you haven&#8217;t even kissed me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; pleaded the girl, pushing him
away. She scarcely understood her mood.
She only knew she did not want Druce to
touch her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; repeated Druce, following
close behind her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; faltered the girl, &#8220;I feel
wicked somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; He led her to a bench and sat
down beside her. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I always treated
you like a lady?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Martin, you&#8217;ve been good to me&mdash;but&mdash;I
feel wicked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce laughed. &#8220;Nonsense, girlie,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t be wicked if you tried. Do
you know what you ought to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn your back on this town where nothing
ever happens and come to little old Chicago,
the live village by the lake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chicago! What could I do there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make more money in a month than you can
earn here in a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can sing,&#8221; said Druce appraisingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re there forty ways when it comes to
looks. Why they&#8217;d pay you a hundred
dollars a week to sing in the cabarets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cabarets?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s interest was
aroused. &#8220;What&#8217;s a cabaret?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cabaret,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;is a restaurant
where ladies and gentlemen dine. A fine great
hall, polished floors, rugs, palms, a lot of little
tables, colored lights, flowers, silver, cut glass,
perfumes, a grand orchestra&mdash;get that in your
mind&mdash;and then the orchestra strikes up and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
you come down the aisle, right through the
crowd and sing to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to do that,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not try it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t know how to begin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, tell me how, quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead easy,&#8221; Druce explained smoothly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to Chicago on the evening
train tonight. Now there&#8217;s no use having
trouble with your folks. They wouldn&#8217;t
understand. You tell them you are going over
to one of the neighbors&#8217;, anything you can
think of. That train slows down at the junction,
right across the field there&mdash;you can
always hear it whistle. I&#8217;ll be aboard the last
car and I&#8217;ll take you to Chicago with me.
Then when we get there we&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly for Elsie started up
from the bench and moved slowly away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, girlie?&#8221; asked Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the girl answered.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anyone here but just us, is there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Druce, watching the girl
closely, &#8220;why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she half whispered, &#8220;it seemed
to me just then that someone touched me on
the arm and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t go!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce started. He looked carefully
around. Then he laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hearing things tonight, Elsie,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no one here but just you and
me.&#8221; He took her by the hand and was drawing
her down to the bench when suddenly the
front door of the cottage opened and Mrs.
Welcome appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie,&#8221; she called. She stood framed in the
lighted doorway, her eyes shaded with her
hand. Like a shadow Druce faded from his
seat beside the girl and dodged behind a tree
out of sight, but in hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Elsie?&#8221; asked the mother. &#8220;I
thought I heard voices. Was Harvey here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl in confusion, &#8220;he has
just gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see anything of your father,
did you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head. &#8220;You&mdash;you don&#8217;t
suppose dad&#8217;s drinking again?&#8221; the girl asked
anxiously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; replied the mother wearily.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t been here all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother,&#8221; the girl wailed. &#8220;What shall
we do?&#8221; She sank down on the seat.
</p>
<p>Her mother took her in her arms. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
cry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come in and help me get
supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for Patience,&#8221; replied the girl.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in the house in a moment. You go
ahead with the work. When Patience comes
we&#8217;ll both help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome walked back into the cottage.
As the door closed behind her Druce reappeared.
He had not missed a word of the conversation
between Elsie and her mother; as he
now approached he outlined in his mind an immediate
plan of attack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie,&#8221; he said softly. The girl started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had gone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No,
don&#8217;t touch me. I&#8217;m in trouble. My father&mdash;&#8221;
she covered her face with her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Druce. &#8220;I heard it all.
Why do you stay here? Why do you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; retorted the girl, too proud
to accept sympathy. &#8220;You made me lie to my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
mother. That is the first time I ever deceived
my mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said Druce. He drew her to
the bench. &#8220;Come,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;be sensible.
Dry those tears. Come with me to Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I could get a chance to
sing in that place you told me of?&#8221; she demanded,
open to argument.
</p>
<p>Druce pressed his advantage. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in one myself. I think I
could arrange to place you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Elsie, &#8220;you said you were in
the live stock business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce hesitated a moment, toying with his
cane. &#8220;I am,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;This cabaret&mdash;er&mdash;is
a little speculation on the side. Come
now, say you&#8217;ll be at the train at eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl considered long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;with one hundred dollars
a week you will be able to take your mother
out of this hole. Why, you&#8217;ll be independent!
You owe it to your family not to let this opportunity
escape you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Elsie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good for you, I mean,&#8221; said Druce.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On one condition,&#8221; the girl went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie got up from her seat embarrassed.
&#8220;It all depends,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On what?&#8221; demanded Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On you, Martin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; Druce laughed uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl walking close to him and
looking him in the face. &#8220;There is only one
way I can go to Chicago with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, girlie?&#8221; was Druce&#8217;s astonished
question.
</p>
<p>Elsie held up her left hand timidly. &#8220;With
a plain gold ring on that finger, Martin,&#8221; she
said. She was now blushing furiously.
She knew that she had virtually proposed to
Druce. He laughed and something in his laugh
jarred her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, marriage,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that Martin, don&#8217;t you? I
couldn&#8217;t go to Chicago with you any other
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce took off his hat. &#8220;Elsie,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you&#8217;re as good as gold. I honor you for your
scruples.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>He paused to think for a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You come along with me and
I&#8217;ll marry you as soon as we reach Chicago.
Meanwhile I&#8217;ll telegraph ahead and arrange
to have you taken care of by my old aunt.
You&#8217;ll be as safe with her as if you were in
your own home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You promise to marry me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I do, girlie.&#8221; He broke off blusteringly.
&#8220;What do you take me for? Do you
think I&#8217;d lure you to Chicago and then leave
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Elsie gravely, &#8220;a girl must
protect herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go, honey?&#8221; Druce persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; replied the girl desperately,
anxious to promise and yet afraid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Druce positively, &#8220;at
eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A cool voice broke in on his sentence. Druce
started like a man suddenly drenched with
cold water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that is going to happen at eight
o&#8217;clock, Mr. Druce?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The speaker was Patience Welcome.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A ROMANCE DAWNS&mdash;AND A TRAGEDY</h3>
</div>

<p>Patience Welcome shared all the
prejudices of her employer, John Price,
against &#8220;city chaps.&#8221; Her observation of
those who had presented themselves in Millville
had not raised her estimate of them. As
a class she found them overdressed and underbred.
They came into her small town obsessed
with the notion of their superiority. Patience
had been at some pains in a quiet way to
puncture the pretensions of as many as came
within scope of her sarcasm. She was not, like
many girls of Millville, so much overwhelmed
by the glamour of Chicago that she believed
every being from that metropolis must be of
a superior breed. She had penetration enough
to estimate them at their true value. In her
frankness, she made no effort to conceal her
sentiments toward them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>But recently there had come into her
acquaintance a product of Chicago whom she
could not fit into Mr. Price&#8217;s city chap category.
This was Harry Boland.
</p>
<p>Young Boland, the son of Chicago&#8217;s &#8220;electrical
king,&#8221; was himself president of his
father&#8217;s Lake City Electrical Company. He
was good looking, quiet, competent and totally
lacking in the bumptiousness that Patience
found so offensive in other Chicago youths.
Toward him Patience had been compelled to
modify her usual attitude of open aversion to
mere cold reserve. She did not quite comprehend
him and until conviction of his merits
came she was determined to occupy the safe
ground of suspicion.
</p>
<p>Patience and Harry Boland had first met on
a basis that could scarcely have been more
formal. The young man, early in his business
career, had been his father&#8217;s collector.
Part of his duties had consisted of collecting
the rents of a large number of workmen&#8217;s cottages
which the elder Boland owned at Millville.
The Welcomes occupied one of these
cottages. As Tom Welcome not infrequently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
was unable to pay the rent when it was due,
Boland had had numerous opportunities for
seeing Patience, who was treasurer of the Welcome
household.
</p>
<p>Her attitude toward him had at first
amused, then annoyed and finally interested
him. When he began to understand what was
back of her coldness a respect, such as he had
felt for no other girl, developed in him. The
more she held him off the more eager he became
for a better acquaintance. This desire was fed
by her repulses. Long ago he had made up his
mind that he loved her. Now, in spite of the
social chasm that yawned between them, he
was determined to win her. His intentions
toward her were honor itself. He was determined
to marry her.
</p>
<p>When Harvey Spencer drove off, after
having introduced Patience to Grogan, the girl
started toward her home. She had gone only
a short distance when a quick step behind her
appraised her that she was followed. A
moment later Harry Boland appeared at her
side, hat in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Miss Welcome?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very well, thank you,&#8221; replied Patience,
primly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful day, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; demanded Harry
inanely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Patience, &#8220;I love the spring
and even Millville is beautiful now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it the most beautiful place in the
world,&#8221; declared Harry enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>Patience looked at him in surprise, then
colored and laughed. &#8220;Do you?&#8221; she said with
the accent on the first word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;that you don&#8217;t mind
if I smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience,&#8221; Harry used the girl&#8217;s name for
the first time with deliberation, &#8220;why don&#8217;t
you speak to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience did not resent the familiarity.
&#8220;I am thinking,&#8221; she replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You act as though you do not like me.
What have I done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that,&#8221; replied Patience shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are trying to avoid me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; She turned and looked
at him squarely. She was determined to dispose
of his attentions then and there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not good at riddles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a moment, then. You are Harry
Boland, only son of the richest and most powerful
man in Chicago. I am Patience Welcome,
daughter of a broken inventor, tenant in
a cottage which you own, where I cannot pay
the rent. Can there be anything in common
between us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry ignored the question. &#8220;You have
forgotten one fact,&#8221; he said. There was determination
in his voice. &#8220;Or don&#8217;t you know
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Patience over her
shoulder, for she had turned from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That Harry Boland is in love with Patience
Welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What an absurdity!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you talk like that to me?&#8221; said
the girl, now agitated. &#8220;Look at me. You
know we are in arrears for rent.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned on him defiantly and looked into
his eyes. Then her glance fell under his more
burning one. She flushed and turned away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said, huskily with humiliation,
&#8220;that you have paid the rent yourself.&#8221;
She was almost in tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t take it like that,&#8221; pleaded
Harry. &#8220;No one but you and me will ever
know. And if you will let me I will take you
away from all this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience raised her head. She had recovered
her composure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All men come to that finally,&#8221; she said
coldly. &#8220;Even in my slight experience I have
learned the phrase almost by heart. All men
say that. They offer&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment.&#8221; Harry put out his
hand emphatically. &#8220;Wait! All the men in
your slight experience may have said it, but all
have not meant it. I mean that if I take you
away from all this I shall take you as Mrs.
Harry Boland&mdash;as my wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; His name was wrenched from
the girl&#8217;s very heart by her surprise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe that I love you now?&#8221; demanded
Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I didn&#8217;t know, I didn&#8217;t understand.
I have wronged you ever since I have known
you. Forgive me. But your father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me call your attention to the fact,&#8221;
said Harry, planting himself firmly before
her, &#8220;that I am many years past the age of
seven&mdash;and can choose a wife for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your father?&#8221; insisted Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he may rage and fume,&#8221; retorted
Harry, &#8220;but I have a standing of my own. I
am president of the Lake City Electric Company
that controls dad&#8217;s patent light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was interested in electricity,
too&mdash;before&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Harry interrupted her. &#8220;Never mind
our fathers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are the chief
characters in this romance, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had reached the path leading to the
Welcome cottage. Patience, eager to end the
interview which had thrown her into a state
of consternation, such as she had never experienced
before, seized the present opportunity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;please go. We are expecting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
father home and&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;it
won&#8217;t be pleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t answered me. I&#8217;m off to
Chicago tomorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow!&#8221; Patience caught her breath
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in my new car. I&#8217;m going to drive
back. I&#8217;ve overstayed my time and there are
business calls which I simply cannot ignore.
I&#8217;ll not insist on an answer tonight, but will
you write me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl put out her hand which Harry
grasped. Her lips quivered and she breathed,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lifted the hand to his lips, but the girl
drew it from him, whispered &#8220;goodby&#8221; and
darted away. He stood watching her until she
disappeared. Patience hurrying toward the
cottage was roused from her tumult of emotion
by the sound of voices. Once she heard
the words &#8220;eight o&#8217;clock,&#8221; without recognizing
the speaker. When they were spoken again
she knew the voice as that of Martin Druce.
She disliked Druce. The thought of his being
alone with Elsie chilled her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>She came toward him swiftly but in silence.
Her question: &#8220;What did you say was going
to happen at eight o&#8217;clock, Mr. Druce?&#8221; was a
complete surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;why&mdash;&#8221; stammered Druce, off his
guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Patience, how late you are,&#8221; interrupted
Elsie to conceal Druce&#8217;s confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little, dear,&#8221; replied Patience, now
confused herself. &#8220;I have been busy at the
store.&#8221; Then she turned to Druce again.
&#8220;What is it about eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;is it something
concerning Elsie?&#8221; she persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I was just saying that I had to meet a
man at the hotel at eight,&#8221; returned Druce, full
of assurance again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Patience, &#8220;well, you&#8217;ll catch him
all right&mdash;if you start now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce laughed. &#8220;Here&#8217;s your hat&mdash;what&#8217;s
your hurry, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience, how can you?&#8221; demanded Elsie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be rude,&#8221; retorted Patience
serenely, &#8220;only I wouldn&#8217;t have him
miss that man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can take a hint.&#8221; Druce started for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
the gate. As he reached it he turned back
to the two girls and added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure hope that man keeps his appointment
to meet me at eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HARRY BOLAND HEARS FROM HIS FATHER</h3>
</div>

<p>Harry Boland strode away from
his interview with Patience deeply
occupied with tumultuous reflections, not seeing
the beauties of Millville which, but a short
time before, he had been enthusiastically celebrating.
He was, in fact, a young man walking
in a dream. Every word the girl had
uttered, every inflection of her voice, the
involuntary confession of affection won from
her by his own no less sudden avowal of love,
projected themselves against his excited mind
with all the vividness of kinetoscope pictures.
He was very happy with these reflections that
come to the youth in love when a familiar
voice suddenly recalled him to mundane
things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there Harry,&#8221; said the voice.
</p>
<p>It was Grogan&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; replied Harry, roused but not displeased
to meet his father&#8217;s intimate political
adviser in this part of the world, &#8220;what are
you doing in this part of Illinois?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on my way home,&#8221; replied Grogan,
laconically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Dad wrote me. You went to
Kansas City, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. Your father caught me on the wire
at St. Louis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the governor want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much. He told me you were
here and suggested that I meet you. He
thought it would be pleasant for us both to
have company home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It dawned on Harry that perhaps his father
had not been quite disinterested in this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good politician, Mike,&#8221; he said
shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a compliment now, or a slander
against my character?&#8221; Grogan demanded,
smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why, might I ask, have you recalled
it at this particular moment?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because your conversation in this particular
instance seemed to me to be that of a person
who was concealing something. Politician&#8217;s
talk, Grogan, is specious, but notable
for its reticence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Harry,&#8221; returned Grogan, &#8220;your
own line of talk is not particularly illuminating,
either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Mike?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here I am, an old friend of your
father&#8217;s, mixed up with him in half a dozen
deals. I&#8217;ve known you ever since you sat in a
high chair and spooned gruel from a bowl.
I come on you in this out of the way corner
and you say never a word of why you&#8217;re here,
or what you&#8217;re doing. I think Clam is your
middle name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Harry, &#8220;I came down to
Millville to collect some rents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only rents?&#8221; queried Grogan pointedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Youngsters of your age sometimes amuse
themselves collecting&mdash;shirtwaists.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop that, Grogan,&#8221; retorted Harry
angrily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stop what, me boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that sort of insinuation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;angry, eh? Then it&#8217;s
as I thought. There&#8217;s always fire in the heart
when a young man flares up about a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Grogan&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, boy,&#8221; interrupted the older man.
&#8220;I&#8217;m your friend and I don&#8217;t want to see you
get into trouble&mdash;with your father, I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he send you to spy on me?&#8221; demanded
Harry hotly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; returned Grogan suavely,
&#8220;only he&#8217;s worried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worried, what the devil about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan did not reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;ve overstayed my time,&#8221; Harry
went on, &#8220;but some of these people have been
difficult. I couldn&#8217;t throw them into the street
when they promised to pay and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; put in Grogan. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not about you. Your father&#8217;s worried about
business. One of these crazy reform waves
has started in Chicago. A vice investigating
committee is raising ructions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by a reform wave?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
What can a vice investigating committee have
to do with my father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; Grogan was picking his
words carefully, &#8220;your father has large interests.
An investigation of that sort unsettles
business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What started the reform wave?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said a girl,&#8221; replied Grogan evenly.
</p>
<p>Harry laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;they all laughed at
her at first, just as you are doing now. But
the joke is beginning to lose its point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name,&#8221; returned Grogan, &#8220;is Mary
Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall,&#8221; repeated Harry. The
words meant nothing to him. &#8220;Who is she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Grogan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never met the lady. That&#8217;s the mystery of her
and she&#8217;s keeping it well. She belongs to the
Randalls of Chicago&mdash;society folk&mdash;that&#8217;s all
I know. But she isn&#8217;t one of these Michigan
boulevard tea party reformers. They just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
talk. She goes out and delivers the goods.
She&#8217;s a fighter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry laughed again. &#8220;This is good,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;An unknown girl, a society bud, working
single handed stirs up Chicago until she
gets all of you alleged smart politicians worrying.
Grogan, I&#8217;m going to write a comedy
about that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you now?&#8221; said Grogan. &#8220;Well, I
don&#8217;t approve of your idea. It&#8217;s not funny.
The other night they raided the Baker Club
and when they came into court they had
evidence enough to hang them all. This Randall
girl had worked in the club for a month
as a waitress and she KNEW.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, Mike, that shouldn&#8217;t affect father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not directly&mdash;no,&#8221; replied Grogan, again
picking his words with care, &#8220;but it gives the
whole city an unsteady feeling. People won&#8217;t
invest their money. If I were in your place,
my boy, I&#8217;d go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off tomorrow in my new car. Better
come with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it tonight and I will,&#8221; replied
Grogan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on,&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go tonight.&#8221;
He surveyed the sky. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
storm,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but even if it does, unless
there&#8217;s a flood the roads will be good. We&#8217;ll
go tonight.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE DEATH OF TOM WELCOME</h3>
</div>

<p>Both Harry Boland and Grogan fell
silent after having reached their agreement
to return to Chicago immediately. To
a degree both men regretted the decision.
</p>
<p>Grogan had accomplished the purpose for
which the elder Boland had despatched him
to Millville&mdash;that of disentangling Harry
from his romance&mdash;but what he had seen of
Patience Welcome had led him to dislike his
task.
</p>
<p>Harry had no sooner promised to drive back
to Chicago in the night than he was assailed
with yearning to see the girl again. Each
occupied himself with his own thoughts. Dusk
descended on the village. They had reached
the corner of the street that led to their hotel
when they were arrested by a maudlin voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, I tell you, Harve.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>Two men came out from beneath the shadow
of the trees and could be seen dimly under the
sickly gleam of a street light. One leaned
heavily against the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; replied the drunken
man&#8217;s companion in a voice both recognized as
that of Harvey Spencer. &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to
see you as far as your house.&#8221; He spoke in
the voice people use in humoring drunken men
and children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t drunk, Harve,&#8221; insisted Harvey&#8217;s
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you ain&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Harvey,
&#8220;come on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just overcome with the heat. I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The reeling man broke off suddenly. He
saw Harry and Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the devil are you?&#8221; he demanded
truculently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Harry Boland,&#8221; replied the
young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the son of John Boland, eh?&#8221; jeered
the drunken man. &#8220;Son of John Boland,
&#8217;lectric light king. John Boland&#8217;s son, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Harry sharply, &#8220;what of it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing I can prove,&#8221; retorted Welcome,
grimly, &#8220;only&mdash;give my regards to your father.
Just tell him Tom Welcome sends his regards.
He&#8217;ll know.&#8221; He began to whimper softly.
&#8220;Poor old Tom Welcome, who might have
been riding in his carriage this day.&#8221; He
stopped whining abruptly and snarled at the
young man: &#8220;If there was any justice on
God&#8217;s earth&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Welcome lurched forward. Harry grasped
his wrist and peered into his bloated face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>Grogan interrupted a good deal agitated.
&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he&#8217;s
just drunk. Come, boy, let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know&mdash;&#8221; persisted Harry, but he
dropped Welcome&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; commanded Grogan,
&#8220;can&#8217;t you see the man&#8217;s drunk? Come on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you I want to know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know anything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry was about to retort angrily when
Grogan seized his wrist with an iron grip and
swung him around the corner. Half dragging
the young man along with him he got him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
the hotel. There Grogan succeeded in convincing
him of the folly of engaging in a street
argument with a dipsomaniac he did not
know.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Harvey and Welcome continued
their slow and stumbling journey to the Welcome
cottage. Welcome, after his interview
with Harry Boland was in a savage mood. A
debauch of two days had left him virtually
a mad man. It required all of Harvey&#8217;s
diplomacy to get him into his house quietly.
</p>
<p>The lights were burning in the living room
when they arrived. Harvey convoyed his
swaying companion to the back of the house,
opened the door quietly and pushed him in.
Mrs. Welcome and the two girls were in the
living room, but the wind was sighing without
and they heard nothing. A storm had come
up with the setting of the sun and occasional
flashes of lightning lighted the darkened room
where Welcome found himself while the
thunder deadened the sound of his stumbling
feet. He made his way through the kitchen
to a bedroom and sank down exhausted on a
bed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>But Tom Welcome could not sleep. Every
nerve in his body jangled. The interview
with young Boland, for reasons which will be
apparent to the reader later, had aroused in
him a smouldering anger. He tossed restlessly
on his couch.
</p>
<p>While he lay there he heard some one knocking
at the front door. All of his perceptions
had grown abnormally keen. He heard a
boy&#8217;s voice and recognized it as that of a
neighbor&#8217;s son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Jimmie,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Pa sent
me over with Elsie&#8217;s veil. She dropped it
while she was out in the auto this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He heard the door close and then the accusing
voice of his wife demanding:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie, who have you been out with, automobiling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was out this afternoon with Martin
Druce,&#8221; replied the girl defiantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; went on the mother, conscious that
a crisis of some sort between her and her
daughter was approaching, &#8220;you were talking
to him this evening and not to Harvey
Spencer? You told me a falsehood?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What if I did?&#8221; Elsie&#8217;s tone was low and
stubborn.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome began to sob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, mother,&#8221; pleaded Patience, &#8220;Elsie
didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did mean it,&#8221; flared back Elsie. &#8220;I did
mean it! Why shouldn&#8217;t I go autoing when
I have the chance? Isn&#8217;t life in Millville hard
enough without&mdash;&#8221; She paused overcome by
a wave of passion. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of Millville,&#8221;
she exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of the factory. I&#8217;m
tired of living here as we do in this miserable,
tumble-down place we call home. I&#8217;m tired
of working like a slave, while a drunken
father&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The words had scarcely left the girl&#8217;s lips
when Tom Welcome, red-eyed, dishevelled,
swaying, appeared in the doorway behind her.
His face was lit with demoniac passion. He
rushed at the girl and she screamed in terror.
With a vicious lunge he struck her down and
then, seizing her by the hair, dragged her into
the bedroom where, amid her cries, he rained
blow after blow upon her.
</p>
<p>Harvey Spencer, just passing through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
gate, heard the first scream. He rushed back
into the house as Welcome, finished for the
moment with Elsie, had returned to the cottage
living room and was approaching his wife
menacingly. He seized the raging man by
the collar and hurled him into a corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll brain you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Welcome stood for a moment glaring at the
intruder. He attempted to speak, but foam
flecked his lips and seemed to choke his voice.
His eyes acquired a fixed and unearthly stare.
He raised his fist as though to strike and then
plunged headlong to the floor.
</p>
<p>Patience was the first to reach her father&#8217;s
side. A vivid flash of lightning followed by
a terrific detonation of thunder rocked the
cottage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dying,&#8221; screamed Patience.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome, forgetting past injuries,
sprang to her husband&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; she wailed, &#8220;speak to me. Tom&mdash;Tom,
I&#8217;m your wife&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dying man tried to sit up. His mania
had passed. He patted his wife&#8217;s shoulder
feebly and smiled. A great weakness had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
come into his face. &#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know what I was
doing. It was the drink. I am going. Call
Elsie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience sprang toward the bedroom, but it
was empty. The open doors through the
kitchen showed how she had fled. As she
searched frantically for her sister, the little
clock on the mantel slowly struck the hour of
eight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone,&#8221; cried Patience. A premonition
of the tragedy of Elsie&#8217;s flight flashed
upon her mind. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;my little
lost sister! My little lost sister!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; cried Harvey. &#8220;Gone where?&#8221;
He opened the door. The rain was falling
pitilessly. &#8220;Not out into this storm. Someone
must find her.&#8221; He rushed out into the
darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; echoed Tom Welcome. His voice
was hollow as a knell. The drink-racked body
stiffened in a spasm and then dropped limply
into his weeping wife&#8217;s arms. &#8220;Gone!&#8221; he
gasped.
</p>
<p>Tom Welcome was dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Another flash of lightning and a roar of
thunder. The two women strove to revive the
corpse. At last the dreadful realization came
to them that Tom Welcome would never speak
again. The wind smote the cottage and the
light in the single lamp in the room fluttered
as though in mortal terror. The skies were
shattered with a final climactic crash of
thunder. The mother and daughter, alone in
that chamber of death, clung to each other
silently feeling themselves isolated from all
mankind, with even the elements storming
against them.
</p>
<p>While they waited, blanched and terror-stricken,
for the last reverberations of the
thunder, the whistle of the Fast Express,
bound from Millville to the great city, rose
wildly on the air, like the scream of an exultant
demon, and died away in a series of weird
and mocking echoes into the night.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH SOME OF CHICAGO&#8217;S BEST PEOPLE<br />ESSAY A TASK TOO BIG FOR THEM</h3>
</div>

<p>Lucas Randall inserted his key
into the door and let himself into his
Michigan boulevard residence. The butler,
busy in one of the reception rooms, looked up
merely to nod a welcome as he entered. Mr.
Randall turned to the mirror in the hallway.
He saw the reflection of a man sixty years of
age, gray but well preserved, intelligent but
not forceful.
</p>
<p>As he turned from the glass he saw his wife
descending the broad stairs. She was small
and fragile. In her youth she had had a delicate
pink and gold beauty. The years had
worn away the pink and the gold but had left
a spirituality that seemed even finer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re home early, Luke dear,&#8221;
he heard her saying. Then noticing his air of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
abstraction she added: &#8220;Did you forget after
all, Luke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget,&#8221; he repeated blankly, &#8220;forget
what, Lucy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh you man!&#8221; replied his wife as if man
were a word of reproach. &#8220;The church committee
is to be here this afternoon to formulate
its report on vice conditions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; Mr. Randall chuckled. &#8220;Yes,
I had forgotten, but anyhow I made it, you
see. How&#8217;s Mary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Randall broke off
suddenly. There was a troubled look in her
eyes. Then she added lightly almost to herself:
&#8220;What a queer child!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Luke, queer,&#8221; returned Mrs. Randall.
Again that troubled look. &#8220;Luke, dear,
I want to make a confession. I don&#8217;t understand
Mary. After your brother Henry died,
when we insisted that Mary come and live
with us, it seemed wicked to leave her in that
great house alone&mdash;and we have no children.
Now, there are times I am almost sorry we
did it. It isn&#8217;t that I want to criticise Mary&#8221;&mdash;noticing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
her husband&#8217;s look of surprise&mdash;&#8220;I
know she loves us both and yet&mdash;well, I have
the feeling that we don&#8217;t really know her.
The intimacy I had longed for hasn&#8217;t developed.
She seems to live a part of her time in
another world than ours.&#8221; She broke off
again, laughing nervously. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I sometimes have the feeling that
Mary lives a sort of double life&mdash;nothing
evil, you know&mdash;but uncanny. She&#8217;s not unkind
nor lacking in affection for either of us,
but often when we are together it seems to me
that her mind is miles away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer, eh?&#8221; said Mr. Randall, sympathetically.
&#8220;Well, her father was like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not strange if she is like her father,&#8221;
charged Mrs. Randall. &#8220;He brought her up
like a boy. After her mother died she was
more like a chum to him than a daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucas Randall became meditative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The church work, now,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;does
she seem interested?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I think she was. I took her on
some of my regular poor people calls. She
seemed interested&mdash;too interested. Why, one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
day I lost her in a tenement on Kosciusko
street. I had to come home without her, half
wild with anxiety. She rushed in an hour
later and when I questioned her as to where
she had been she replied that she had found a
poor Scotch family and had been so interested
that she had forgotten me. &#8216;Forgotten&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
the very word she used. She said she
had been &#8216;seeking the causes of poverty.&#8217; I
told her poverty came from people being poor,
but that did not seem to satisfy her. She
asked me why they were poor. I answered
that often it was because they were shiftless.
&#8216;Not always,&#8217; she replied, &#8216;these Scotch people,
aunt, dear, were strangely like you and me.&#8217;
She spoke as if I were the one who did not
understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And since then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she has seemed to prefer going
alone.&#8221; Mrs. Randall paused on the verge of
a new confession. &#8220;Luke, dear,&#8221; she went on
hurriedly, &#8220;Mary goes into sections of the city
you have warned me not to visit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the Levee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Randall,
&#8220;surely she doesn&#8217;t go alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, except for her maid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl she took from the Refuge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anna.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mary now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In her room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll come down to the committee meeting,
I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her and she replied that of course
she would come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she been out today, Lucy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Calls, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s been attending the hearings of
the vice commission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, why?&#8221; Mr. Randall was
really disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her that very question. She replied
that the proceedings interested her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; Mr. Randall paced the room.
&#8220;&#8216;Interested&#8217; her! A girl with an income she
can&#8217;t possibly spend, a girl who might have
anything, do anything, go anywhere, marry
any man&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>He broke off suddenly. &#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he demanded,
&#8220;is there any man Mary might care
for? That good looking young curate, for
instance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Randall shook her head emphatically.
&#8220;No, Luke,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you were to ask me
to name the two things Mary never gives a
thought to I&#8217;d say men and matrimony. And
that&#8217;s another thing about her I cannot
fathom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Further confidences were cut short by the
entrance of the butler announcing the Rev.
Thomas Brattle, a clergyman of sixty with an
old fashioned flowing white beard, small white
hands and shiny gold-bowed spectacles, and
Marvin Lattimer, a business man with a turn
for religious activities. Desultory conversation
followed broken by the entrance of Mrs.
Sumnet-Ives, a well preserved woman of
forty and a social power, and Miss Emma
Laforth, slender, dark, intelligent looking and
gifted with a political acumen that had given
her an unassailable position in women&#8217;s club
circles. They were escorted by Grove Evans,
plump, wealthy, well born, mildly interested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
in reform because reform was the proper
thing, and Wyat Carp, a lawyer with literary
tendencies.
</p>
<p>Greetings and small talk; then Lucas Randall
led the way to the library. There the
Rev. Mr. Brattle, clearing his throat in an
official manner, established himself before a
priceless seventeenth century table of carved
mahogany.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The meeting will come to order,&#8221; he announced.
</p>
<p>A circle of chairs had been drawn up before
the table. The committee members occupied
them with a subdued rustle of garments. The
Rev. Mr. Brattle watched the circle benignly,
waiting for a moment of total silence. When
he spoke his voice was smooth, finely modulated,
pitched in the right key. His manner,
in fact, was perfect. Indeed, in the spacious
luxury of Lucas Randall&#8217;s fine library no one
could have appeared to better advantage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear friends,&#8221; he said, beaming about him,
&#8220;we are gathered here, as you know, to formulate
the report of our investigation into vice
conditions. You have labored long and faithfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Now the time has come to put forth
the fruit of your labors in a form at once concrete
and illuminating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, then continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem we are approaching is world-old.
Mankind has struggled with it intermittently
since civilization began. Apparently
we have made no progress. The twentieth
century, in fact, with its terrific congestion in
cities, its vast consumption of nervous energy
and its universal commercialism, has complicated
our problem. But with these new complications
have come new means for warring
against the evil. Intelligence on the subject
is more general. Fine minds everywhere are
addressing themselves to the riddle. Thus it
seems that humanity is at last coming to grips
with the traffic in women. Who knows but
that out of this little gathering may not be
evolved some theory which, injected into the
circulation of modern life, shall immunize us
against this social malady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was subdued applause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As my time has been somewhat occupied,&#8221;
the clergyman went on, &#8220;I have asked Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Carp to employ his well known literary gift
in formulating our report. Let me add that
I have read our brother&#8217;s resumé of our investigations
and endorse it fully as to the facts
found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wyat Carp, with his best poet&#8217;s
air, had arisen and bowed to the little circle.
He laid a terrifying number of manuscript
sheets on the table and polished his glasses
with his silk handkerchief. His was the subdued
manner of a surgeon about to perform
an operation and, it must be confessed, his
audience felt some of the sensations of the
patient.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; began Wyat Carp, &#8220;in putting
before you what I trust you may see fit
to adopt as our united report I am naturally
moved by a feeling of delicacy&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, for directly behind the little
circle of hearers the heavy curtains had been
pushed aside, and a girl stood framed there
against the dull red of the draperies. She was
rather above medium height, with a figure
rounded by exercise, a face oval and lighted
by deep blue eyes underneath masses of burnished,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
coppery hair. Her personality seemed
to fill the room. She breathed wholesomeness,
vigor, sincerity and purpose.
</p>
<p>As Lucas Randall half started from his
chair the girl put out her hand and checked
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Luke,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t disturb
yourself. I&#8217;ve been standing just outside the
door for several minutes waiting for a moment
to slip in quietly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She bowed to them all, and seated herself
near the window overlooking the boulevard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just go on with the report, Mr. Carp,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I assure you I am most eager to hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyat Carp coughed gently and picked up
his manuscript.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Randall,&#8221; he began
gravely, &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were saying that you were moved by
a feeling of delicacy,&#8221; prompted the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Randall.&#8221; Mr. Carp
bowed. &#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;am experiencing a feeling
of embarrassment because this is a meeting of
both sexes and the subject is one which, only
recently, has been discussed in mixed company.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
When one so young as yourself is
present&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied the girl, a shade of amusement
in her voice, &#8220;please don&#8217;t let my youth
interfere with our deliberations. I assure you
that, young as I may appear to be, I am quite
familiar with the matter we have under consideration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This remarkable declaration caused something
of a real sensation. Mrs. Sumnet-Ives
mentally put the speaker down as &#8220;a pert little
chit.&#8221; Grove Evans was amused, for he disliked
Carp. Mrs. Randall catalogued it as
another ebullition of Mary&#8217;s queerness; even
her uncle, despite an affection that accepted
everything Mary did as right and proper, felt
himself a little shocked. As for Miss Laforth,
she favored Miss Randall with a long,
inventorying inspection. Here, she reflected,
might be a future political rival.
</p>
<p>Mr. Carp began to read slowly with here
and there a pause to enable his audience to
catch a subtle turn of phrase or the flowing
rhythm of his periods. He read while the
light grew fainter and the fire glowed more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
brightly, read until Lucas Randall leaned
across the table and switched on the light in
the great brass lamp.
</p>
<p>Mary Randall, deep in her easy chair beside
the window and lulled by the soporific monotone
of Mr. Carp&#8217;s voice, saw the afternoon
darken into dusk and the dusk deepen into
night. Before her half-closed eyes the city,
slowly but purposefully, began to throw off
the habiliments of day and don the tinsel of
evening. One by one, from far down the
spacious avenue, the street lamps glowed into
bulbs of color which the wet asphalt, like a
winding black mirror, caught up and flung
against the polished finishings of a swift and
silent train of automobiles and the windows
of the nearby mansions.
</p>
<p>And still Wyat Carp read on and on, skirting
the outer circle of forbidden subjects, leading
up to closed doors he made no attempt to
open, expatiating voluminously on conditions
that all the world knew, elucidating the
obvious, ranging from one platitude to another&mdash;and
avoiding the vital and concrete as
though it were poisonous. And as Mr. Carp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
read Mary became oppressed with his total
futility.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Ives risked a hasty glance at her
jeweled wrist watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the man know it&#8217;s nearly time to
dine?&#8221; she wondered.
</p>
<p>Grove Evans, with a dinner engagement at
the club and a place bespoken in a quiet poker
game afterward, squirmed in his chair and
cursed Wyat Carp silently. Finally, with a
last rhetorical flourish, Mr. Carp quite suddenly
ended. He sat down amid a murmur of
applause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Ives. She
was agreeably astonished that Mr. Carp should
ever have finished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very full, concise and to the point,&#8221; was
Miss Laforth&#8217;s verdict.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; announced Grove Evans, really
delighted, for he would be in time for dinner
at the club after all.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Brattle gazed about the
circle with a bland smile. &#8220;I am glad,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;to have my judgment indorsed by such
excellent critics.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Then, rapping gently on the table, he
glanced about him. &#8220;A motion is in order
before we adjourn, my friends,&#8221; he stated,
expectantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I move Mr. Carp&#8217;s report be adopted as it
stands,&#8221; said Marvin Lattimer breathlessly.
He had waited patiently all afternoon to speak
just those words. His business judgment, as
applied to social affairs, had taught him the
wisdom of getting into the record. He was
only a recent confidant of this inner circle of
All Souls and he aspired to remain where he
was. Besides, it would be something to tell
the socially ambitious Mrs. Lattimer when he
got home. There was a second from Miss
Laforth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear the motion,&#8221; breathed the
reverend chairman. &#8220;Those in favor will
please say &#8216;aye.&#8217;&#8221; As they all responded he
beamed upon them. He turned with a deprecatory
glance to Carp. &#8220;And as a matter of
form, those contrary minded will please
signify by saying &#8216;no.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waited a moment. Quite clearly and
distinctly Mary Randall spoke:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tiny monosyllable seemed to echo and
reecho through the high-ceiled room. There
was a most embarrassing silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; faltered Mrs. Randall.
</p>
<p>Mary came over and pressed her hand
against her aunt&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Believe me,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to wound you. You
don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; Then turning to the Rev.
Mr. Brattle, she went on: &#8220;But I must insist
that my vote in the negative be recorded in the
minutes of this meeting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I inquire the cause of your&mdash;er&mdash;peculiar
attitude?&#8221; asked the clergyman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that fair, Dr. Brattle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly not fair, but perhaps our curiosity
is pardonable.&#8221; There was suppressed sarcasm
in his retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In your little speech of introduction, my
dear doctor,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;you advanced the
suggestion that this meeting might evolve
some theory that would rid society of the social
evil. The great trouble with this report is
that it is all theory. I have no quarrel with
the facts that Mr. Carp has given us, except
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
that they are old&mdash;&#8216;world old,&#8217; as I think you
said. Weeks have been spent on this investigation
and yet there is not one word&mdash;not a
single word&mdash;that answers the appeal going
up in this city day after day from thousands
of unfortunate women. We sit here, after
weeks of investigation, and listen to a homily.
The time is past in Chicago for homilies. The
question is: What are we going to do about
it? Helpless thousands are asking us that
question and we answer it with a treatise full
of &#8216;world-old&#8217; truth and full of &#8216;theory.&#8217; Mr.
Carp speaks of the resorts on Dunkirk street
being &#8216;questionable&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are questionable,&#8221; defended Mr.
Carp stoutly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Questionable, Mr. Carp,&#8221; replied Mary,
&#8220;is a gentle word. These resorts are a shrieking
infamy. They are markets in which young
girls are sold like cattle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; demanded Grove
Evans, almost rudely. He felt his club appointment
slipping away from him and the
poker game owed him two hundred dollars.
</p>
<p>Mary looked from her aunt to her uncle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;because I have been
there. I know because I myself bought four
girls there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The company gasped its surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told them I was &#8216;in the business&#8217; in
Seattle,&#8221; the speaker continued. &#8220;I told them
I wanted to buy. I asked for four girls&mdash;four
young girls. They sold me four for one hundred
dollars each.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a silence for a long moment. It
was broken by Marvin Lattimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Mary looked at him sadly. &#8220;There is one
fact more impossible than that, Mr. Lattimer,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It is that men of the world
like you&mdash;men who, above all others, should
make it their business to know these things,&mdash;cry
out &#8216;Impossible!&#8217; when such a fact is
exhibited before you in all its hideousness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have had the man who sold
those girls arrested,&#8221; blurted Grove Evans.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Mary quietly, &#8220;and <i>The
Reporter</i>, in which you are a part owner, suppressed
publication of the fact. I had the
man arrested and Jim Edwards, the politician
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
who holds the district in the hollow of his hand,
prevented the case from going to trial. That
man walks the streets of Chicago free and
without bond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl turned to Dr. Brattle again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are a clergyman.
You are the shepherd of the flock. Are you,
too, deaf to the appeal that goes up daily from
the sinks of this city,&mdash;from hundreds of
ruined girls? Do you, too, stand by while
wolves rend the lambs? Do you deny the
existence of the wolf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can only strive to educate these
women, to teach them the error of their way,&#8221;
pleaded the shepherd.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, doctor, while you are educating one,
the wolves are tearing down twenty. They
&#8216;educate,&#8217; too, and their facilities are better
than yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl stopped breathlessly and, stooping
swiftly, kissed her aunt. There were tears in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Then suddenly she crossed the room and
threw open the door. The maid, Anna, stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
there with a satchel at her feet and Mary&#8217;s
cloak upon her arm. Mary picked up the
satchel and turned toward the street door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The time for theory alone is over,&#8221; she
said, addressing the company. &#8220;Someone has
got to go into action against the wolves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door swung behind her and she stepped
out into the boulevard.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURES OF A NEWSPAPER STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>Great cities thrive on sensations. The
yellow journal with its blatant enthusiasms
and its brazen effrontery finds a
congenial habitat there, not because it is
brazen, nor even because it is enthusiastic, but
because it supplies a community need. The
screaming headline is a mental cocktail. Bellowed
forth by a trombone-lunged newsboy,
it crashes against the eye, the ear and the brain
simultaneously. It whips up tired nerves. It
keys the crowd to the keen tension necessary
for the doing of the city&#8217;s business. And the
crowd likes it. Fed hourly on mental stimulants,
it becomes a slave to its newspapers.
</p>
<p>On the morning after Mary Randall&#8217;s
dramatic exit from her uncle&#8217;s mansion
Chicago awoke and clutched at the morning
papers with all the eagerness of a drunkard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
reaching for his dram. A hint of a powerful
new thrill lay in the half disclosed first pages.
Black headings and &#8220;freaked&#8221; makeup meant
but one thing&mdash;a big story.
</p>
<p>And Chicago was not disappointed. Occupying
the place of honor on the first pages of
all of the morning sheets was the announcement
of a new assault upon the Vice Trust.
To the crowd the name Mary Randall meant
nothing. It knew little of her and cared less.
But the idea of a young girl, beautiful, socially
prominent, immensely wealthy in her own
right, declaring war single-handed on a monster
so mightily armored and intrenched and
so brutally strong as the Vice Trust appealed
instantly to the crowd&#8217;s imagination. In the
crowd&#8217;s thought, at least, the girl became a
heroine. And though the man in the street
openly wearing an air of cheap cynicism spoke
of her as &#8220;another crazy reformer&#8221; or as a
&#8220;notoriety-hunting crank,&#8221; secretly he responded
to the enthusiasm of the headline
writer who announced her as a &#8220;modern Joan
of Arc.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mary had given out the story herself. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
simple letter from her to the city editors announcing
that she had left her home and all
the luxuries that such a home implied and,
accompanied only by a maid, had set forth on
a war of extermination against the &#8220;vice ring&#8221;
had been sufficient to set every local room in
the city in a frenzy. Re-write men and head
writers had done the rest. Every newspaper
recorded the launching of her adventure with
a luxuriance of illustration and a variety of
detail that left nothing more to be said on the
subject. Mary had counted rather shrewdly
on this. She possessed, among her other
natural gifts, a keen judgment of news values.
She knew, too, the immense power of the
press. By enlisting the agencies of publicity
behind her she had multiplied her forces a
thousand-fold. At the end of her letter Mary
had written a modest appeal to the public.
Every newspaper printed it under display
type. It read as follows:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;<i>TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF CHICAGO.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>Our city, which should be the heart of
American honor, is in the grip of a hideous
System. So quietly and surely has this
monster worked that our civic blood is
poisoned. It feeds upon youth, innocence and
purity&mdash;all that we as decent citizens love best.
I call upon you all to stand by me now in my
fight to kill the White Slave Traffic.</i>
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<i>Mary Randall.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Grove Evans read that appeal through and
smiled at its naïveté. Then he looked across
his office to his partner, William Brierly, a
younger man with pompadour hair and an
habitual air of immense self-satisfaction.
Brierly was reading the same story in another
newspaper. He, too, looked up and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know this girl, don&#8217;t you, Grove?&#8221;
Brierly asked. &#8220;By George, she must be interesting.
A new kind of female maniac, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve met her,&#8221; responded Evans. &#8220;She
was at the Country Club during trophy match
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
last fall. Carries herself like a queen. I
remember your raving about her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Brierly&#8217;s derisive smile faded. &#8220;That
girl, eh? Say, I saw her make the ninth hole
in three. That girl! Say, look here, Grove,&#8221;
he struck the open paper with his palm, &#8220;does
she mean this stuff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Evans lighted a cigarette before replying.
&#8220;She sure does,&#8221; he stated finally. &#8220;I was at
the Randalls when she delivered her ultimatum
and took to the war path. Talk about a
jolt! After she left us, you could hear the
shades of night falling. For ten minutes we
sat there exhibiting all the vivacity of a deaf
and dumb man at a Quaker prayer-meeting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Brierly laughed. &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll do what all these suffragettes do&mdash;run
around in a circle, yell herself tired, then
marry some fellow and forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He yawned. Evans turned to the huge safe
and got out a heavy packet of papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Grove?&#8221; Brierly
demanded lazily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; responded Evans curtly. &#8220;Just
looking over some of our shady leases.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Brierly, getting on his feet.
&#8220;Are you taking this thing seriously?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Evans turned with a folded paper in his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life I am,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I
know this girl. There&#8217;s a strain of wild Irish
in her and it&#8217;s my opinion that she&#8217;s going to
raise merry hell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dreamer who had visited the Millville
Button Works with the owner of the mill
lunched with his friend in the city that day.
Quite casually, among other items of interest,
Mary Randall&#8217;s adventure came up for discussion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the girl,&#8221; said the mill-owner,
&#8220;but her announcement gives me a fairly good
mental picture of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your picture?&#8221; inquired the journalist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A rag and a bone and a hank of hair, one
of these raving suffragettes. Since bomb-throwing
and burning are not fashionable over
here, she&#8217;s chosen this means of expending her
surplus energy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear friend, you&#8217;re entirely wrong!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What! You&#8217;ve seen her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, but I have quite a different mental
picture of her. You remember Joan of Arc?
Mount her on a charger, hand her a sword of
fire and send her forth to fight for Mary
Magdalene. That&#8217;s my idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve borrowed that from the headline
writers,&#8221; the mill-owner said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I know the type. A thoughtful
young girl, healthy, cultivated and, by the
modern miracle, taught how to think. She
studies vice conditions in Chicago at first hand
and what she sees turns her into a crusader.
This girl has spirit. Brought face to face with
a great evil, moved by the appeal of helpless
womanhood, she throws aside her veneer of
false education.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unsexed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you would say that the crisis in her
life unsexed Portia. Or the crisis in France&#8217;s
history unsexed Charlotte Corday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fond of historical allusions,&#8221;
chided the practical man. &#8220;Always the literary
man, always the dreamer. This girl is a
disturber. She&#8217;ll unsettle business.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there you are. &#8216;Unsettles business.&#8217;
Did it ever strike you business men that you
take yourselves too damn seriously? Any
movement, any agitation that &#8216;unsettles business&#8217;
is ipse facto wrong. You business men
have had a hand in the martyring of most of
the saints and all of the reformers since time
began. And, invariably, you are wrong.
Why, you&#8217;re wrong even about yourselves.
You firmly believe that the foundations of the
country rest upon you. As a matter of fact,
not one per cent of you are producers. You&#8217;re
middlemen, profit shavers, parasites.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; asked his friend, &#8220;where
would you be if business men&mdash;publishers&mdash;didn&#8217;t
buy your wares?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; answered the writer, &#8220;and where
would the publishers be if I and others didn&#8217;t
produce the wares to market? It won&#8217;t do.
The reason the newspapers and magazines of
this country are so bad is because most of the
publishers are not newspaper men and magazine
writers, but merely business men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose your Joan of Arc will
have to have her fling. Then life will swing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
back to its same old channels and we&#8217;ll forget
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she will have her fling and perhaps
we&#8217;ll forget her, but life will not swing back
to the same old channel. She&#8217;ll make a new
channel, forgotten though she may be, and it
will be a better channel.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Captain Shammer of the Eighth police district
read Mary Randall&#8217;s open letter through
slowly and carefully. When he had finished
he lighted a long black cigar from a box that
had been sent him by a world famous confidence
man. He smoked thoughtfully for
some time. Then he put out a heavy hand
and, without looking, pressed a white button
at the side of his desk.
</p>
<p>A sharp-eyed young man opened the
captain&#8217;s door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;shut that door a
minute and come over here.&#8221; He pointed to
the black newspaper headline.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, first thing this morning, Captain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We should worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain Shammer rolled his cigar in his
mouth. He wasn&#8217;t exactly satisfied with the
answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed finally, &#8220;but Nick&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain.&#8221; Nick paused alertly, one
hand on the door knob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy for a while until we see how things
break on this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curtains drawn, you know, and back
rooms quiet. Tell the girls to go slow on the
piano playing. Did Ike, the dip, come
across?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, Captain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinch him today and give him the cooler.
Get me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done, cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Close in on the stuss games. Pass the word
to go easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall, eh?&#8221; asked Captain Shammer
of vacancy when his aid had gone. &#8220;Mary
Randall! Well, Mary, you sure have got
your nerve with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Senator Barker was a member of the
Governor&#8217;s vice investigating committee. The
committee had been appointed to frame a
minimum wage law for women. He was a
person of ponderous bulk and mental equipment.
He had slipped into office, not because
the people yearned for him, but because there
had happened to be a battle on between two
factions of his natural political opponents in
the fortunate hour he had selected for aspiring
to office. Like most other American officeholders
he spent his days and nights scheming
out ways to continue living at the public&#8217;s
expense. He perused Mary Randall&#8217;s screed
as he sat over his morning grape-fruit.
</p>
<p>In an intermission in the committee meeting
Senator Barker leaned across the heavy oak
table and pointed out the letter to the Rev.
Wallace Stillwell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; he inquired huskily.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stillwell nodded and drew his thin lips
together. He was quite young and just now
carried the burden of having been called from
an obscure country pulpit to a fashionable
church in Chicago. He knew that the wealthy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
man who was his sponsor in this new position
was interested in whole blocks of houses whose
curtains were always drawn. He had never
forgotten a certain phrase that great man had
used when he came in his own automobile to
bear the young pastor to the new field of his
labors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you, Mr. Stillwell,&#8221; he had said,
&#8220;because we believe you to be a safe and sane
man, one who will not be swept off his feet by
wild-eyed reformers and the anarchistic tendencies
of the times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stillwell, therefore, knew why he was
wanted in Chicago. The knowledge made him
cautious in all things. He thought Senator
Barker&#8217;s question over carefully. Then he
nodded calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Senator,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;One
could hardly avoid reading it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean, Senator?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know. What do you think of it, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; purred the Rev. Wallace
Stillwell, &#8220;that the whole exploit is worse than
fantastic. It is hardly in good taste. Investigations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of the kind this girl has undertaken
ought to be left to the men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; put in the Senator,
gloomily, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve noticed lately that the
women don&#8217;t seem to be willing to do that.
They want to take a hand in such matters
themselves.&#8221; He leaned back in his chair
sadly. &#8220;It certainly makes it hard for us
politicians.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A woman of ample girth and a handmade
complexion pushed her coffee cup away and
lighted a fresh cigarette. She had just
finished reading Mary Randall&#8217;s manifesto.
Nature had made her beautiful, but advancing
years and too much art had all but destroyed
Nature&#8217;s handicraft. She inhaled the acrid
smoke deeply and then raising her voice,
called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Celeste! You, Celeste!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A mulatto girl threw open the door, crying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, madame?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleaning up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a bottle of wine. Or did those high
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
rollers guzzle it all last night, the drunken
beasts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, madame. I&#8217;ve saved one for you.&#8221;
She opened the bottle and placed the effervescent
liquid before her mistress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Celeste. Anybody up yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so, madame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m up and I wish I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; announced
a girl who appeared at that moment
coming down the broad staircase. She entered
the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a head this morning, eh, Nellie?&#8221; said
the madame, knowingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got a head,&#8221; replied Nellie sullenly,
&#8220;and a grouch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it two, Celeste,&#8221; said the madame
promptly, indicating the bottle. The colored
maid poured out another glass of the liquor.
Madame threw the paper across the table to
the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s something that
will make you worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked the girl, as she caught up
the paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Front page, big headlines. You can&#8217;t
miss it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl stepped to the window and pushed
aside the heavy curtain. In the morning light
she was revealed there petite and charming,
despite penciled eyebrows and carmined lips.
Her figure was daintily proportioned. There
was grace in every line. Her deep brown eyes
glowed as she read the words Mary Randall
had written.
</p>
<p>When she finished reading the girl
crumpled the paper in her hand and filled another
glass. She lifted the wine slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to you, Mary Randall,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a rotten toast,&#8221; said the madame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;Well, let me tell
you something. I&#8217;d like to go straight out of
this house and find Mary Randall and say to
her: &#8216;I&#8217;m with you, Mary Randall, and I hope
to God you win out.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think of me,&#8221; whined the older
woman. &#8220;Look what a knock that reform
stuff gives business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Nellie&#8217;s temper flared into a flame.
&#8220;Say, you ought to be in jail! Now don&#8217;t start
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
anything you can&#8217;t finish&mdash;&#8221; The older
woman had got to her feet menacingly. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t deserve no pity. You got into this&#8221;&mdash;she
indicated the gaudily furnished house by
a gesture, &#8220;with your eyes wide open. You
picked out this business for yourself. But
with me it&#8217;s different.&#8221; She leaned across the
table defiantly. &#8220;Yes, how about me? How
about Lottie and Emma&mdash;and that poor kid
that came here happy because she thought
she&#8217;d found a decent job? Did we pick out
this business? Did we? Not on your life.
We walked into a trap and we can&#8217;t get out.
Yes, and there&#8217;s thousands like us all over this
country.&#8221; She snatched up the bottle and
poured more wine. &#8220;I&#8217;m for you, Mary
Randall,&#8221; she said, raising the glass to the sunlight.
&#8220;More power to your elbow!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Mary Randall read the newspapers in a
garret room of a tall lodging house. A pile of
letters, in a peculiar shade of dark blue, sealed,
stamped and ready for the postoffice, lay in a
heap before her. She went through each
newspaper carefully, noting the display and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
studying the &#8220;features&#8221; of her story that had
impressed the newspaper men. At last she
laid them down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Anna,&#8221; she said, smiling, addressing
her maid. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made a good beginning.
The town, you see, is interested in us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anna&#8217;s ordinarily impassive face smiled
back at her mistress&#8217; enthusiasm. Her blue
eyes lighted with admiring loyalty. She was
blonde, big boned and so strongly built as to
look actually formidable. Competency and
reserve power fairly radiated from her. Her
voice betrayed her Scandinavian ancestry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ya-as,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and in another week
they&#8217;ll be fighting for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mary got up from her chair and went to the
window, threw it wide open and looked out on
the city. She saw its myriad lights rimming
the shore of the inland sea. She heard its roar&mdash;deep,
passionate, powerful. In her imagination
she laid her ear close to the city&#8217;s heart
and she heard it beat strong and true. The
smile had left her face and a prayer formed
itself silently on her lips. The revery lasted
only a moment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for the next movement
in the battle.&#8221; She indicated the letters.
&#8220;There&#8217;s our ammunition, Anna,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Mail them. I&#8217;ve picked you for a great
honor. You&#8217;re to open the engagement with
a fusillade of bombshells.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A BOMB FOR MR. GROGAN</h3>
</div>

<p>The telephone in the outer office of the
Lake City Telephone Company rang
insistently. Miss Masters, the stenographer,
after the fashion of stenographers, let it ring.
At length the telephone gave vent to a long,
shrill, despairing appeal and was silent. Then,
and then only, did Miss Masters lay aside the
bundle of letters she was sorting and pick up
the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Apparently a voice responded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak a little louder, please,&#8221; the girl said
impersonally. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear a single word
you&#8217;re saying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>More words from the outside poured
through the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Miss Masters nodded mechanically.
&#8220;Yes, this is the main office of the Lake City
Electrical Company. What?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>There was another pause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Miss Masters at the &#8217;phone,&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I&#8217;m
the stenographer. What&#8217;s that?
Private secretary? Yes, I am Mr. John
Boland&#8217;s private secretary. No, our president,
Mr. Harry Boland, has not come downtown
yet. We are expecting him at any
moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A red-headed office boy stuck an inquisitive
head through the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;someone for
the boss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters merely motioned him to
silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;his father, Mr. John
Boland, will be in some time during the morning.
Who shall I say called?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl waited for the answer and hung
up the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Miss Masters?&#8221; inquired the
boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dickey, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any of
your business,&#8221; retorted Miss Masters good-naturedly.
&#8220;But, for fear you&#8217;ll burst with
curiosity, I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s Mr. Martin Druce.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Happy as a crab this morning, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;
jeered the boy. &#8220;Well, you want to look out
for that geezer, Druce. He&#8217;s a devil with the
girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters made a face at him and the
boy, whistling derisively, disappeared through
the door, not failing to slam it loudly after
him.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters resumed her letter sorting.
The door opened slowly. A man entered with
his hat over his eyes. His hands were deep in
his pockets and he chewed a despondent looking
cigar. Had the reader been present he
would have recognized him instantly, despite
his unaccustomed air of lugubriousness, as our
old friend, Mr. Michael Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; said Miss
Masters cordially.
</p>
<p>Grogan made no reply. The girl went on
with her work. Then as if communing with
herself she said: &#8220;And yet they say the Irish
are always polite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said Grogan, rousing himself,
&#8220;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters vouchsafed no reply. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
merely laughed. Grogan, conscious that he
was being chaffed, stared at her. He was
pleased with what he saw. He found Miss
Masters handsome. Her office dress, slit at
the bottom and displaying at this moment a
neat ankle, was ruched about the neck and
sleeves. It was a rather elaborate dress for a
stenographer, but John Boland was a vain
man and liked to have the employes he kept
close about him maintain the appearance of
prosperity. In fact, he paid these particular
employes well with the explicit understanding
that they would keep their appearance up to
his standard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making light of me gray hairs, I
see,&#8221; said Mr. Grogan, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;I said good morning
to you and you didn&#8217;t even grunt in reply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The top of the morning to you, Miss Masters,&#8221;
said Grogan, hastening to remedy his
oversight and removing his hat with an ornate
bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, and I&#8217;m wishing you the same and
many of them,&#8221; replied the girl.
</p>
<p>Mr. Grogan bowed again and added:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And, if I have failed in the politeness due a
lady, I begs yer pardon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re forgiven, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; replied
Miss Masters, resuming her work.
</p>
<p>Grogan returned to his meditations. He
was regarding his mutilated cigar ruefully
when Miss Masters observed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If all of the millionaires were as thorough
gentlemen as you are, Mr. Grogan, we
wouldn&#8217;t have any labor unions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The word millionaire seemed to sting
Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thank you,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;to leave
me out of the millionaire class.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; said the girl, surprised,
&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I&mdash;wanst,&#8221; retorted Grogan,
&#8220;but now when any one says &#8216;you millionaire,&#8217;
faith, I get ready to dodge a brick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it would be pleasant to
know you had a million dollars.&#8221; There was
a note of envy in the girl&#8217;s voice.
</p>
<p>Grogan rose slowly, walked to the desk and
leaned across it confidentially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it always was,&#8221; he said sententiously,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
&#8220;but now they&#8217;re beginning to ask, &#8216;Where
did you get it?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not &#8216;Oh,&#8217; I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; said Grogan,
&#8220;it&#8217;s &#8216;Ouch!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s disturbing you, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&mdash;and somebody. &#8217;Tis a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Grogan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whist!&#8221; retorted Mr. Grogan, &#8220;You don&#8217;t
get me meaning. It&#8217;s not the kind you buy ice
cream sodies for. No! This lady has a club
in her fist and a punch in both elbows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspicion so, and I&#8217;m oneasy in me mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s silly to worry, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; said Miss
Masters, &#8220;sit down and look over the papers.&#8221;
She extended a morning newspaper, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may as well.&#8221; Grogan took up the
paper and selected a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stirring times in Chicago, just now,&#8221; said
the young woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re stirring, all right,&#8221; Grogan
agreed. &#8220;They&#8217;re too stirring. What I want
is peace. I&#8217;d like to pass the rest of my days
in quiet&mdash;quiet&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>The sentence expired on his lips as he stared
at the front page of the paper held open in
his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; said
Miss Masters starting up, alarmed.
</p>
<p>Grogan wiped his forehead and moistened
his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s hot and I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He threw the newspaper on the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;give me another newspaper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl picked up another paper from
the heap on the corner of the desk and passed
it across to him. Grogan looked at the headlines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help&mdash;murder,&#8221; he cried. Then he cast
the paper on the floor and got to his feet
abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Grogan,&#8221; asked the girl, &#8220;what is the
matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked for quiet,&#8221; Grogan replied, picking
up the papers and shaking them angrily,
&#8220;and on the front page of this paper is a letter
written and signed by Mary Randall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And why should Mary Randall disturb
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know she writes to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Writes to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&mdash;and then some,&#8221; was the
grim response. &#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh!&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s one of the last of them.&#8221; Grogan
took a dark blue envelope from his pocket,
extracted a single sheet of the same color and
read.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Grogan:&mdash;Do you remember what
your old Irish mother said to you when you
left Old Erin to seek your fortune in the new
world? She said: &#8216;Mike, me boy, don&#8217;t soil
your hands with dirty money.&#8217; Mary
Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t soil your hands with dirty money,&#8221;
repeated Miss Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice billy dux to find beside your
plate at breakfast, ain&#8217;t it now?&#8221; demanded
Grogan. Then after a pause he murmured
half to himself,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me old Irish mother, God bless her, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
her white hair and her sweet Connemara face!
I can see her now, just as she stood there that
day in the door of our cabin when I went off
up the road, a slip of a boy, with a big bag
of oatmeal over me shoulder&mdash;one shirt and
me Irish fighting spirit. That was me capital
in life, that and her blessing. She&#8217;s sleeping
there now, and the shamrock is growing over
her&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan stopped. His voice had grown
husky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he demanded turning on Miss
Masters abruptly, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you make me
stop? Don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m breaking me heart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl had really been moved. &#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;because&mdash;&#8221; She got out her powder
puff and proceeded hastily to decorate her
nose. She was still engaged in this operation
when the telephone rang. Grogan started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s only the telephone. What is the
matter with you, Mr. Grogan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; responded Grogan despondently,
&#8220;I&#8217;m as nervous as a girl in a peek-a-boo
waist.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>The telephone rang again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer that?&#8221; demanded
Grogan sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no
great rush, is there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes there is,&#8221; insisted Grogan, &#8220;I can&#8217;t
bear the suspense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young woman laughed and picked up
the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lake City Electrical Company,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;What? Who is it, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan, who had continued pacing up and
down the office, stopped and made wild gestures
to Miss Masters. Covering the mouthpiece
of the instrument so she would not be
heard, the girl asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Grogan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whist!&#8221; replied Grogan, &#8220;If that is Mary
Randall on the wire there, I&#8217;ve gone to Alaska.
I&#8217;ve given all me money away and I&#8217;m living
on snow balls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters smiled and replied with assurance:
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t Mary Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for that,&#8221; breathed Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; went on Miss Masters into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
telephone. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re long distance?
Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but Mr. Harry Boland hasn&#8217;t
come downtown yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may be in any moment&mdash;shall I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She broke off sharply as Harry himself
came in the door drawing off his gloves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Just a moment please,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;He has just come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone for me, Miss Masters?&#8221; the
young man inquired, hanging up his hat on a
rack by the door. Without waiting for a reply
he turned to Grogan. &#8220;Good morning, Mike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a fine day&mdash;I hope,&#8221; returned Grogan
cautiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, someone calling you, Mr. Boland,&#8221;
broke in Miss Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to talk to anyone,&#8221; said the
young man curtly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, hello,&#8221; continued Miss Masters at
the telephone. &#8220;Hello, long distance? Mr.
Boland is too busy&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, please,&#8221; interrupted Harry quickly,
&#8220;did you say &#8216;long distance?&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Miss Masters nodded. &#8220;Just a moment,&#8221;
she said into the telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long
distance. Some one wants to talk to you in&mdash;Millville,
Illinois.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>BAD NEWS FROM MILLVILLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The word Millville had an instantaneous
effect on Harry Boland. It was, in fact,
the most pleasant sound he had heard in days.
Upon returning to Chicago after his lover-like
interview with Patience Welcome he had
dispatched a long letter to her. To this he
had received no reply. Then he wrote two
letters in one day. Neither of them had been
answered. Thoroughly disturbed now, but
too busy to leave Chicago himself, Harry
had sent his confidential man, John Clark, to
Millville to learn, if possible, the cause of
Patience&#8217;s silence.
</p>
<p>While Harry stood eagerly waiting for the
&#8217;phone Miss Masters was busy getting the
long distance connection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she said at last,
&#8220;here&#8217;s your party.&#8221; Then into the telephone
she continued: &#8220;Yes&mdash;Mr. Boland is here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
waiting. He will talk to Millville. Hello&mdash;hello&mdash;Millville?
Hello!&#8221; She handed Harry
the instrument.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t answer that &#8217;phone for a thousand
dollars,&#8221; put in Grogan dolefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello&mdash;hello!&#8221; exclaimed Harry.
</p>
<p>A shrill whistle rent the air and Grogan
jumped hysterically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The postman&#8217;s whistle,&#8221; replied Miss
Masters calmly, repressing a smile as she
started for the outer door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Millville, hello,&#8221; called Harry
Boland, not getting his connection.
</p>
<p>Grogan beckoned Miss Masters to his side.
&#8220;If there&#8217;s a letter there for me in an envelope
like this,&#8221; he said producing the dark blue letter
from his pocket, &#8220;you keep it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Miss Masters now smiled openly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it,&#8221; reiterated Grogan, &#8220;don&#8217;t show
it to me or I&#8217;ll climb up the side of the building
and jump off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters thoroughly amused vanished
into the hall. Meanwhile Harry Boland was
talking to Millville.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Millville?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes this is Harry
Boland. Oh!&#8221; He paused with a distinct
note of disappointment in his voice. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s
you, Clark? Yes I know&mdash;You&#8217;ve something
to report about the Welcomes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Welcome family,&#8221; said Grogan,
pricking up his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m listening,&#8221; Harry went on.
&#8220;Yes, I get you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that now,&#8221; continued Grogan
reflectively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, you needn&#8217;t wait there any longer&mdash;All right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Asking your pardon,&#8221; ventured Grogan,
&#8220;may I take the liberty of an old friend to
inquire what Mr. Boland wants with a bum
family like the Welcomes&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment, Mike,&#8221; interrupted Harry
putting out his hand imperatively. &#8220;You&#8217;re
speaking of the girl I mean to marry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan gaped at the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am?&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; replied the other. He rose to
his feet and turned tranquilly toward Grogan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
&#8220;Now what are you going to say?&#8221; he inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Grogan, too surprised to
talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Harry pointedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the old man is no good,&#8221; hazarded
Grogan. &#8220;Tom Welcome is a worthless&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead, Mike,&#8221; interrupted Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; This was a day of surprises for
Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; repeated Harry, &#8220;died the
night we left Millville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Grogan&#8217;s manner had changed.
&#8220;There were some good points about the man,
after all. I&#8217;ve heard he&#8217;d never take a drink
alone&mdash;if he could avoid it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Welcome family has moved
away,&#8221; Harry went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one knows. I&#8217;ve been too busy to
investigate myself so I sent Clark to locate
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; said Grogan. &#8220;Then it was Clark
you were talking to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Harry impatiently,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t you hear?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, but&mdash;&#8221; Grogan broke off
abruptly. &#8220;Say, didn&#8217;t that fat fellow who
was going to be a detective, the fellow who
nearly killed me riding on his grocery wagon,
didn&#8217;t he know anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s left Millville, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Grogan incredulously.
&#8220;Do you mean to say a bunch like that can
drop out of a town like Millville without anyone
knowing where they&#8217;ve gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you. The facts speak for
themselves,&#8221; said Harry.
</p>
<p>Both men were silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike,&#8221; said young Boland suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were married?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Irishman was too surprised by the
question to answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you speak about your wife,&#8221;
Harry insisted.
</p>
<p>Grogan still vouchsafed no answer. He
stood staring at Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you speak of your wife, Norah,&#8221;
repeated Harry, &#8220;in a way that made me feel
how sacred her memory was to you. She married
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
you, a husky young Irish laborer in the
mills, and how that little woman worked for
you, toiling, saving, scrimping, tending the
babies as they came! How you worshiped
her, and big man as you were, how a word
from her would make you kneel at her feet.
You held her in your arms when the little
mounds were raised in the church yard&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan listened in silence, deeply moved.
He put out his hand and grasped Harry&#8217;s
firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I love Patience Welcome,
Mike,&#8221; went on Harry, &#8220;just as you loved
Norah McGuire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; broke in Grogan huskily, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; He turned suddenly and demanded,
&#8220;Well then, why in hell don&#8217;t you
find her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll help ye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Mike,&#8221; said Harry, putting his
arm around Grogan&#8217;s shoulders, &#8220;Aha, you
can&#8217;t beat the Irish!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can,&#8221; responded Grogan, &#8220;but
they won&#8217;t stay beaten.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
entrance of Boland senior. He hung up his
hat, took off his gloves and rubbed his hands
together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;good morning Harry&mdash;Mike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning, Governor,&#8221; returned Harry
tersely. Grogan acknowledged the salutation
with a grunt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have Miss Masters make out a lease for
that house in South Twelfth street,&#8221; went on
the elder Boland briskly. He laid some papers
on the table. &#8220;Here is the copy of the present
lease with the necessary changes noted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the lessee?&#8221; inquired Harry carelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Carter Anson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Harry in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded
the father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Mike,&#8221; said the young man turning
with a smile to Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to answer any questions,&#8221; declared
Grogan. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a little rule I learned in
politics.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Carter Anson is going to be indicted by the
grand jury,&#8221; Harry informed his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said John Boland, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been reading
the yellow journals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re yellow,&#8221; conceded Harry, &#8220;because
they contain so many golden truths.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall, please write,&#8221; sneered the
elder Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! No!&#8221; Grogan, who had been sitting
down jumped to his feet in protest. The
others looked at him in astonishment. He sat
down again shamefacedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
Mary Randall to write to me,&#8221; he admitted
dolefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you, Grogan?&#8221; inquired
John Boland sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A blue envelope&mdash;a sheet of blue paper
with words on it, and&mdash;I&#8217;ve got a pain in the
back of my neck.&#8221; Grogan brought forth the
blue letter again and gazed at it gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; John Boland informed him
curtly. Then he turned to Harry. &#8220;Look
here, my boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t be a fool&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s your son,&#8221; interrupted Grogan chuckling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Mike. You know, Harry, I
own that property with Mike here, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan interrupted again. &#8220;Look here,
John Boland,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;how much will
you give me for my share?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours,&#8221; said Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why it&#8217;s worth double that!&#8221; exclaimed
John Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that. It&#8217;s yours,&#8221; repeated
Grogan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give two thousand for my peace
of mind any day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you crazy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet&mdash;but I&#8217;m headed that way. Take
it at two thousand and I&#8217;ll love you, John.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Governor,&#8221; protested Harry, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t let a fool reform wave scare
you,&#8221; burst out the father irritably. &#8220;Did
you ever see a vice investigation get anywhere?
Never! Just a lot of talk and&mdash;letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters appeared with a package of
letters in her hands. &#8220;Mail, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she
said. She began sorting the letters. &#8220;Four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
for you, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;and a
special for Mr. Harry Boland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan had been watching her intently.
He breathed deeply and muttered: &#8220;Sure and
I&#8217;m an old fool. Why should I be afraid of
letters? Who could write&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters interrupted. &#8220;And one for
you, Mr. Grogan,&#8221; she said casually.
</p>
<p>Grogan dropped into his chair crying:
&#8220;Help!&#8221; Then cautiously he took the letter
from Miss Masters. The envelope was white
and he heaved a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the deuce ails you this morning,
Grogan?&#8221; demanded John Boland irritated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting second sight,&#8221; returned Grogan
gloomily, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be a fool.&#8221; John Boland began
opening his mail. &#8220;All this investigating,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;this talk of a minimum wage law,
is just talk and that&#8217;s all. Now take this crazy
woman&mdash;Mary Randall&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>While he spoke he had opened a letter containing
a second enclosure. It was an envelope
of a peculiar shape and its color was dark
blue.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE READER MEETS ANOTHER OLD ACQUAINTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The sight of the blue envelope had transfixed
Grogan. He stood staring at it
like a man in the presence of a ghost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blue envelope, again,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;A
harpoon for you, John.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Boland made no reply. He reached
for his paper knife, ripped open the envelope
and drew forth a sheet of blue note paper.
He read with a gathering frown what had
been written on it. Then he reread it, muttering
under his breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it hurt you much, John?&#8221; inquired
Grogan, enjoying the other&#8217;s discomfiture.
</p>
<p>For answer the elder Boland scrutinized
Grogan over his glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about this, Mike?&#8221; he
demanded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Only that I got one of those blue bombs
myself this morning,&#8221; retorted Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this.&#8221; John Boland flourished
the envelope angrily. &#8220;&#8216;The owner of property
who leases same to vice is morally responsible
for the crimes committed on his premises.
Mary Randall.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned to Grogan. &#8220;What do you think
of that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hit home,&#8221; replied Grogan grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn her, for a brazen busybody,&#8221; blurted
Boland angrily. &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she mind her
own business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Harry was opening an envelope
the exact counterpart of his father&#8217;s. He read
the note twice and stood considering its
import.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another of &#8217;em?&#8221; said the elder Boland.
&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s yours, Harry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine?&mdash;Oh,&mdash;mine&mdash;why,&#8221; the young
man faltered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, can&#8217;t you speak?&#8221; demanded
the father irritably.
</p>
<p>Harry returned no direct reply. Opening
his note he read:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We count on young men like you, Harry
Boland, to lead the fight we are making
to save our Little Lost Sisters. Mary
Randall.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; chuckled Grogan, &#8220;you know how
I felt when I got my little blue envelope this
morning.&#8221; As he spoke he tore off the end of
the envelope which he had held unnoticed. Inserting
his finger and thumb into the envelope
he went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, I never did like the color of
blue&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off as he lowered his eyes to the
enclosure he had brought out. It was another
blue letter. Grogan started up and jerked out
the note. Holding it at arms&#8217; distance he
read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The strength of Ireland is in the purity
of her sons and daughters. Mary Randall.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three men stood staring at each other
in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall.&#8221; John Boland broke the
silence with a sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall,&#8221; repeated Harry quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh you Mary Randall!&#8221; put in Grogan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
with just a touch of admiration in his voice.
&#8220;She&#8217;s the lady champion lightweight. Three
knock-outs in three minutes. &#8217;Tis a world&#8217;s
record!&#8221; He turned to the elder Boland.
&#8220;Does the punch she gave you hurt much?&#8221;
he inquired.
</p>
<p>Boland glared at Grogan. &#8220;Who the devil
is Mary Randall?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never met her,&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a member of the wealthy Randall family. Her
mother died when she was young and I understand
she was brought up very quietly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know her, Miss Masters,&#8221; persisted
Boland.
</p>
<p>The girl was startled, &#8220;I&mdash;why&mdash;I?&#8221; she
hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;do you know
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl still hesitated and Grogan broke
in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a woman, Miss Masters,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you ought to know all the feminine quirks.
Now it&#8217;s up to you. Who&#8217;s Mary Randall?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall is a wealthy girl,&#8221; said Miss
Masters calmly. &#8220;She has grown weary of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
the foolish methods you men have employed
in attacking the vice problem. Convinced of
your total incompetence she has started out
really to do something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she want?&#8221; snorted John
Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She said in a printed letter,&#8221; replied Miss
Masters, &#8220;that she wanted to put several property
owners and crooked senators in jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan was impressed by this statement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to buy the rest of my South
Side property, John?&#8221; he inquired of Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she know she&#8217;s disturbing business?&#8221;
asked Boland of Miss Masters, ignoring
Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall also said,&#8221; the girl replied,
&#8220;that the greatest business in the world is that
of redeeming &#8216;Little Lost Sisters.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, you see,&#8221; said Grogan, &#8220;the
farther you go, John, the more punches you
get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to bother with this foolishness,&#8221;
said Boland. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a big contract
on with the Simmons people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went to the door of his son&#8217;s office.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on Harry&mdash;you too Mike. Come in,
Miss Masters, and take down this contract.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three men started toward the door. As
Grogan passed Miss Masters he whispered:
&#8220;Young woman, if any more blue skyrockets
come for me, play the hose on them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the girl, smiling.
</p>
<p>Having secured her notebook she started
toward the inner office when a smartly dressed
young man entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello girlie,&#8221; he said, intercepting her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; replied Miss Masters
primly. &#8220;What&#8217;s your business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just like that, eh?&#8221; said the youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl sharply. &#8220;What do
you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. John Boland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t see him now. He&#8217;s busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sharp, impatient call from the
inner office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir, I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; replied the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be quick about it,&#8221; returned the
voice. &#8220;Do you think I can wait all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s John Boland, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; inquired the
man eagerly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Miss Masters nodded assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell him&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; broke in the girl, &#8220;but he&#8217;s
busy. He won&#8217;t see anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, tell him when you can that
Martin Druce called.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Druce!&#8221; Miss Masters kept her
eyes on the blank page before her, but she
made no effort to make a memorandum of the
name. She added slowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You called on the &#8217;phone this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did.&#8221; Druce, with the familiarity
of an old acquaintance, began toying with the
silver vanity box Miss Randall wore suspended
from her neck. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on insinuatingly,
&#8220;you have the sweetest voice&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better tell me why you want to see Mr.
Boland,&#8221; she said quietly taking the vanity
box from him and putting him at a distance.
At the same time she smiled at him archly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just want to renew a lease&mdash;the Cafe
Sinister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some swell place,&#8221; replied Druce with
pride.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said the girl. She pantomimed
counting money. &#8220;Yes, as long as you can
keep the police asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in&mdash;what the deuce do you mean?&#8221;
Druce inquired quickly.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters shrugged her shoulders.
Again she smiled at him archly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re wise, eh?&#8221; Druce laughed. He
felt that he was on familiar ground with this
girl. There was that in her manner that indicated
the wisdom of the demi-monde. He
thought he had placed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wise, eh?&#8221; he repeated. The girl
had maneuvered to place a table between
them. He leaned against the table and placed
a hand on hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does a fine looker like you spend her
life pounding a typewriter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you advise a change?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could make a hundred a week in the
cabarets,&#8221; declared Druce admiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied Miss Masters. She
picked up her notebook and started for the
inner office. &#8220;But I know where that road
leads.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Druce was daunted with this reply. It
wasn&#8217;t at all what he had expected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he jeered, &#8220;you&#8217;re one of the goody-goody
kind, are you? Fare you well. I&#8217;ll see
you in church Sunday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was now at the inner office door.
She turned and eyed Druce narrowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she replied without anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, some day, I&#8217;ll see you wearing
stripes and looking through iron bars!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door shut swiftly behind her, leaving
Druce staring at the panels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that,&#8221; he spoke
aloud, though there was no one in the outer
office to hear him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, kid&mdash;you&#8217;re no boob, anyway.&#8221;
He turned on his heel and walked
out.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH THE WOLF IS BITTEN BY THE LAMB</h3>
</div>

<p>John Boland was a very capable business
man. He possessed the combination
of shrewdness, ability to grasp and marshal
details, and that utter selfishness which the
world from time immemorial has rewarded
with huge accumulations of money. He
had one of those minds which find their recreation
in intrigue. Unembarrassed by a conscience
and unhampered by scruples he drove
directly to his goal&mdash;success.
</p>
<p>As head of the Electric Trust Boland was
compelled to be at once a financier and a
politician. The faculties for success in both
fields are closely allied; in both Boland was
eminently triumphant. Sitting in his office
day after day, unmoved by events that might
have disturbed other men and unstirred by
emotions that might have turned other men
from their paths, he looked out over the city
and &#8220;played his game&#8221; with all the cold impassiveness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of a gambler operating an infallible
system in roulette. No detail was too small to
escape his notice, no agent too ignoble to serve
his purpose.
</p>
<p>These facts are mentioned to explain the
relationship that existed between John Boland
and Martin Druce. In these two men, the
social extremes of the city met&mdash;Boland, the
financial power and leading citizen; Druce,
the dive keeper and social outcast. They met
because Boland wished it. Druce was one of
the creatures that he could and often did use
in his business.
</p>
<p>Although ostensibly ignorant of the very
existence of Druce, Boland in reality had the
man often in his thoughts. He kept these
thoughts hidden in that inner chamber of his
mind from which, from time to time, emerged
those inspirations that had made his name a
by-word on La Salle street for supernatural
astuteness. Not even the most intimate of his
coworkers guessed them.
</p>
<p>For nearly a month now Druce had been
calling at Boland&#8217;s offices intent on obtaining
a renewal of his lease to the Cafe Sinister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
During that entire month he had never been
able to obtain even a word with the master
financier. Boland had purposely refused to
grant the interview so frequently requested by
Druce not because he had any repugnance
against doing business with the dive keeper
but because to his mind there had never appeared
any good reason why he should grant
that interview. He played the waiting game
with Druce because he had found by profitable
experience that the waiting game paid John
Boland best. The time might come when he
would be able to use so excellent a tool as
Druce to its best advantage. Boland was waiting
calmly for that time. If Druce suffered
in the interim John Boland was unable to see
how that was any of his concern. In fact,
Boland figured, the more Druce suffered, the
keener a tool he would be for his purposes.
</p>
<p>Druce guessed something of this. He too
possessed a mind adapted to intrigue. Therefore
every rebuff from Boland found him
undaunted. He knew that his time must
come. He called at Boland&#8217;s offices again and
again, smiling always in the face of denial.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Of late a new incentive for calling at the
Electric Trust&#8217;s offices had developed for
Druce. This was furnished by Miss Masters.
The girl&#8217;s charming looks had aroused the
man&#8217;s curiosity and cunning. Her air of
worldly wisdom, her alternate repulses and
advances, had stirred him as he had rarely
been stirred before. In his eagerness to possess
her he almost lost sight of the main object
of his visits.
</p>
<p>But whether by accident or design Druce
was never able to get a word with the girl
alone. She was always, save on the sole occasion
of his last visit, either engaged with Harry
Boland&#8217;s dictation, or, if in the outer office,
chaperoned by Harry Boland&#8217;s red-headed
office boy. One day Druce met Red in the
lower corridor of the Electric Trust building.
The boy grinned knowingly at him and yelled
as he hurried by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry on my account,&#8221; answered
Druce, but at the moment it came to him that
Red&#8217;s chaperonage of Miss Masters might not
be entirely accidental.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>Druce stepped into the elevator and was
let out at the Electric Trust&#8217;s offices. He entered
and found the offices empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the little fool,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t
know which side her bread is&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning whom?&#8221; inquired Miss Masters&#8217;
saccharine voice.
</p>
<p>Druce turned quickly and saw Miss Masters
coming from the inner office. He was impressed
by the attractiveness of her dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she get all the glad rags?&#8221; he
demanded of himself. &#8220;Maybe old Boland&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s a little fool?&#8221; persisted Miss
Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody,&#8221; returned Druce. &#8220;Just talking
to myself. Mr. Boland&#8217;s out or busy, I
suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Boland&#8217;s out,&#8221; replied Miss
Masters. She sat down at a typewriter and
inserted a sheet of paper in the machine. &#8220;He
left a message for you, however. He told me
this morning that if you called I should ask
you to &#8217;phone him about twelve o&#8217;clock. He&#8217;ll
try to see you then for a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;thanks.&#8221; But he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
made no move to go. He watched the girl as
she hammered the typewriter keys. Presently
she looked up at him inquiringly.
</p>
<p>This to Druce appeared to be a direct offer
to open a conversation. He hastened to take
advantage of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied in his most ingratiating
manner, drawing near her. &#8220;I want to talk
to you. I have been dying to speak to you
alone, girlie&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl rose from her chair and picked up
her notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Druce,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, girlie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters opened the notebook and took
a lead pencil from the shining rolls of her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to keep a record of all callers,&#8221;
said the girl unexpectedly. &#8220;Mr. Boland is
very particular about it. Let me see, your
name is Martin Druce?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She wrote the name into her book and
showed it to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the name correctly, haven&#8217;t I, Mr.
Druce?&#8221; she went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather tardy with your duties, aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
you?&#8221; inquired Druce with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
coming here for some days now and you
haven&#8217;t wanted to put me into your book
before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
noticed you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce was sure now that he was beginning
a flirtation with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And your business?&#8221; continued the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Boland knows my business,&#8221; replied
Druce, with an air of carelessness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt he does, but I don&#8217;t. And how
can I keep my records properly if I don&#8217;t
know? I can&#8217;t bother Mr. Boland with these
details. What is your business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;ah&mdash;&#8221; hesitated Druce. &#8220;Live
stock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of live stock?&#8221; persisted Miss
Masters, preparing to write down his answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; Druce began to feel that he was
being badgered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of live stock do you deal in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; snarled Druce, &#8220;what are you
trying to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters&#8217; answer was perfectly calm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&#8220;I am trying,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to find out what kind
of live stock you deal in, Mr. Druce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ashamed to tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce turned on the girl as though stung.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I be ashamed?&#8221; he blustered.
He moved toward the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know that,&#8221; replied Miss Masters,
&#8220;when you tell me what kind of live stock you
deal in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a stern quality in Miss Masters&#8217;
voice that Druce had noticed in the voice of a
district attorney with whom he had once had
an unpleasant interview. The man was a
coward. He wanted to be off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every kind,&#8221; he blurted. &#8220;Good day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later he found himself in the
hallway. &#8220;Red,&#8221; the office boy, had just come
from the elevator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Druce?&#8221; demanded the
boy. &#8220;You look pale around the gills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to hell, you little rat,&#8221; retorted
Druce, and without waiting for the elevator
vanished down the steps, with the jeering
laughter of the boy ringing in his ears.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SEARCH BEGINS FOR THE LOST SISTER</h3>
</div>

<p>There was nothing in Miss Masters&#8217;
manner after Druce had made his hasty
departure to indicate that she felt any thrills
of triumph over the completeness of the dive
keeper&#8217;s rout. On the contrary she seemed
unaccountably depressed. She sat down at
her typewriter thinking deeply. Presently
her meditations were disturbed.
</p>
<p>The door opened quietly. A man entered
who, in spite of the shabbiness of his clothing,
his emaciation and the haggardness of his
features the reader would have had no difficulty
in recognizing. He was Harvey Spencer.
He stood in the open door looking at the
girl uncertainly. She took him in in a glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; she said sympathetically.
&#8220;You are looking for someone here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; replied Harvey enigmatically, &#8220;but
he&#8217;s gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gone?&#8221; repeated the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the caller quickly, &#8220;perhaps
you can give me some information. That
man, who stepped in here a moment ago&mdash;you
know who he is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;his name is Martin
Druce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his name, yes&mdash;what&#8217;s his business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Live stock, he says,&#8221; replied Miss Masters
in some surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know where he lives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m following him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was bewildered. &#8220;Are you a
detective?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>The question produced an extraordinary
effect on the young man. He threw up his
head and gave vent to a short, sharp
exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; he said. &#8220;No,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I once
thought I was a detective, but I woke up.&#8221;
Then he started for the door. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221;
he said. As he reached for the knob he reeled
and clutched at the wall for support. Miss
Masters started toward him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said, &#8220;sit down. Aren&#8217;t you
feeling ill? Let me get you a glass of water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She drew a glass full from a cooler and
carried it to the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s warm,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re exhausted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey gulped the contents of the glass,
and looked at Miss Masters mournfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes&mdash;mighty warm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for a job?&#8221; inquired Miss
Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to be,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Harvey&#8217;s despondency deepened,
&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl from down state?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Miss Masters, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
belong to Chicago. Your clothes tell me that.
And the girl&mdash;she was from your own town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it?&#8221; Miss Masters&#8217; manner
was friendly. She drew a chair and sat down
opposite the young man. Harvey was so
moved by this unlocked for sympathy that
tears filled his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Her name,&#8221; he said huskily, &#8220;was Elsie
Welcome. She ran away. Her father had
beaten her. On the night she left the father
died. We were to have been married. I
learned that she had come to Chicago with this
man&mdash;Martin Druce. I followed her. For
days I have tramped the streets. Today I
caught a glimpse of Druce as he entered an
elevator in this building. I had just reached
here when I lost sight of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door behind him opened slowly. Miss
Masters looked up to see a gray haired woman
enter. She wore a waist and skirt of dead
black with a little old fashioned black bonnet.
Her face was sweet with motherliness, but
drawn with sorrow and exhaustion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvey,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Harvey turned and hurried to her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you come in here, Harvey,&#8221; the
woman went on, &#8220;so I followed. I hope we&#8217;re
not intruding Miss&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Masters is my name,&#8221; responded the
stenographer quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the girl&#8217;s mother,&#8221; said Harvey.
&#8220;This is Mrs. Martha Welcome.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Miss Masters hastened to bring another
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And your daughter,&#8221; she asked quickly,
&#8220;have you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think there was anything wrong
in Elsie&#8217;s going away,&#8221; interrupted Mrs.
Welcome. &#8220;She wasn&#8217;t happy and her
father&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father beat her,&#8221; said Harvey wrathfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvey,&#8221; chided Mrs. Welcome, &#8220;Tom&#8217;s
dead. He wasn&#8217;t a bad man, Miss Masters.
He lost his courage when he lost his invention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Miss Masters sympathetically.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t heard anything
from your lost girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mrs; Welcome sadly, &#8220;not
a word. Patience and I and Harvey came to
the city hoping to find her&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my other daughter,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Welcome, &#8220;two years older. Elsie was my
baby.&#8221; Her voice broke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; she went on in subdued
tones, &#8220;if she&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ve prayed, too.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Seems as though I&#8217;ve prayed every minute
that God would bring my baby back to me.
You don&#8217;t think it makes any difference, do
you, Miss Masters, even if we are in a great,
noisy city? God is here, too, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put out her hand impulsively and Miss
Masters took it into her own cool palm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, God is here,&#8221; she replied reverently,
&#8220;though sometimes it is hard to have faith
and believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey had walked away and stood looking
out at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Patience,&#8221; he said suddenly.
</p>
<p>Patience Welcome entered almost immediately.
She was dressed in the same somber
black as her mother. She wore a heavy veil
pushed back from the brim of her hat. Harvey
presented her to Miss Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve good news for you, mother,&#8221; exclaimed
Patience after acknowledging the introduction.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a place in that office I went
into when I left you. I begin work tomorrow.
Then when I came out and missed you I was
terribly frightened, but the elevator man told
me you had come in here. And so I found you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother has been telling me something
about the search for your sister,&#8221; said
Miss Masters. &#8220;Perhaps I may be able to
help you. Could you tell me something about
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Patience, &#8220;we need
help. It seems as if we had exhausted all our
own resources. But we mustn&#8217;t stop now.
Mother is worn out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Miss Masters, &#8220;it would
be better if this young man should take your
mother home. You and I may be able to talk
the situation over more confidentially if we
are alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you can help us?&#8221; inquired Patience
eagerly.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters was thoughtful. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I believe I have unusual facilities for
helping you. I know a great deal about
Chicago&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Patience, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put our case in
your hands. I know I can trust you. Somehow,
I feel better already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took Miss Masters&#8217; hands in her own,
confidently.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Miss Masters, a little
tremulously, &#8220;you can trust me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey in the meantime had helped Mrs.
Welcome with her wraps and was leading her
toward the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow in a little while,&#8221; said Patience,
as the two passed out the door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be home
in time for supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Miss Masters, after Harvey
and Mrs. Welcome were gone, &#8220;first tell me
if you have any money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience hesitated. Such a question coming
from a stranger embarrassed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;I think we have
enough money. Harvey brought fifty dollars
with him and Mother was given some money
by a man who came to our aid, in Millville&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Millville?&#8221; interrupted Miss Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued Patience, &#8220;that is the town
we live in. The man&#8217;s name was Dudley&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dudley!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience looked at Miss Masters in surprise.
&#8220;You know him?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters hesitated. &#8220;The name seems
familiar,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was a stranger in Millville,&#8221; Patience
went on. &#8220;My mother wired to her sister,
Sarah, for money after Elsie left us and my
father died. My aunt sent us forty dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause after this explanation,
then Miss Masters went on hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Miss Welcome,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;if I speak plainly to you. Were there any
strangers in Millville about the time your sister
went away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strangers?&#8221; repeated Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any attractive young men,&#8221; pursued Miss
Masters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; stammered Patience in
confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were, I see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think my sister&mdash;&#8221; burst out
Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; interrupted Miss Masters,
&#8220;but when an innocent country girl leaves her
home suddenly it is a good rule to look for&mdash;the
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think some one lured Elsie away?&#8221;
said Patience stifled by the thought. &#8220;That
some man is to blame?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t an easy thing to say, my dear, but
I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there laws against such crimes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Masters, &#8220;but these
laws were made by men, and men have always
shown an unwillingness to legislate against
their sex. Now there were some young men
in Millville at the time your sister went away,
weren&#8217;t there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Patience, &#8220;two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know their names?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Druce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him.&#8221; Miss Masters opened
her memorandum book. &#8220;Martin Druce,&#8221; she
read, &#8220;dealer in live stock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Patience, &#8220;he told us that
was his business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other stranger, Miss Welcome?
Do not hide any of the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not say,&#8221; replied Patience
hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better tell me,&#8221; urged Miss
Masters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed the girl, &#8220;it hurts
me even to think that he&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better tell me,&#8221; Miss Masters persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other young man,&#8221; said Patience,
&#8220;was&mdash;Harry Boland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Miss Masters sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Harry Boland?&#8221; Patience
flushed and stood up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. You are in the Bolands&#8217; outer offices
at this moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had scarcely spoken when the door of
Harry Boland&#8217;s office opened and the young
man came out.
</p>
<p>Patience drew her heavy veil down over her
face and darted toward the outer door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a corrected form of that contract,
Miss Masters,&#8221; said young Boland brusquely.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>JOHN BOLAND MEETS MARY RANDALL</h3>
</div>

<p>But Patience did not leave the office of
the Lake City Electrical Company as
quickly as she had hoped to do. She was intercepted
by the young man, who deliberately
placed himself between her and the door,
effectually blocking the way.
</p>
<p>He eyed the small figure in black with
an inquisitiveness which was almost rude,
attempting to peer through the meshes of the
heavy veil, as he spoke to Miss Masters:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, I thought you were
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before she could reply a rasping voice
called from the inner office:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Harry, send Miss Masters in here,
will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Governor wants you, Miss Masters,&#8221;
said Harry, his eyes still on Patience.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Mr. Boland,&#8221; proclaimed the
stenographer.
</p>
<p>With only a glance at her companions, she
made a detour of the desk in the center of the
room and glided into the other office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Miss Masters may be kept busy
for some time,&#8221; volunteered Harry kindly,
&#8220;but if&mdash;if you care to wait&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience only bowed her head and attempted
to pass him; but she caught her
breath quickly and her body swayed slightly,
but perceptibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; went on Harry,
fencing for time.
</p>
<p>Again endeavoring to pass him, she staggered
and put out one hand to steady herself,
which Harry clasped quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She made a movement to release her hand
as she recovered from the dizziness which had
seized her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put up your veil, dear,&#8221; said Harry
gently. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it is you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please!&#8221; pleaded Patience. The word
was scarcely audible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Put up your veil,&#8221; he persisted.
</p>
<p>When she complied, he gazed into her deep,
dark eyes and stroked her hand tenderly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think I could be in the same room
with you and not know you? Oh, my dear&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Harry, no!&#8221; protested Patience, withdrawing
her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knew how long and patiently I&#8217;ve
searched for you, I don&#8217;t think you could be
so unkind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only safe way,&#8221; she replied, stepping
away from him and clutching the back
of a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked as he went close to her
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you do really care for me and
you&#8217;re fighting against yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let me go,&#8221; begged Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; returned the young man stoutly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; she pleaded distractedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just turn around,&#8221; was the smiling retort,
&#8220;and run straight into the arms of the man
who loves you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And bring trouble and sorrow on you?
No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been through the deep waters of grief and
suffering. Harry, I&#8217;ve been hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hungry!&#8221; exclaimed Harry. &#8220;Oh, my
poor girl, you must let me&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience shook her head slowly, sadly; an
eager light of desire for his love and tender
care illuminated her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love me?&#8221; pursued the young man
fervently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t ask me that&mdash;wait!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And lose you again?&#8221; He laid his hand
on one of hers. &#8220;No; I want my answer
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A harsh, commanding voice interrupted
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patience started and drew her hand from
beneath the other&#8217;s touch as an elderly man
came into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, a little surprised,
but entirely composed as he went on:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Governor, I want you to meet the young
lady who is to be my wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; ejaculated John Boland, scarcely
believing his own ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Patience Welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome?&#8221; the older man turned his back
to conceal the startled expression which came
over his features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. This is my good old dad, Patience,&#8221;
said Harry, laying one arm affectionately
about his father&#8217;s shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather sudden, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; demanded
Boland, senior, in a sharp tone.
</p>
<p>But Harry was accustomed to his father&#8217;s
abrupt ways and gave no heed to the testiness
of the query.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Governor, I met Miss Welcome when
I was in Millville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; hemmed John Boland, truculently
unmindful of the introduction. &#8220;But
just now get that contract off; Miss Masters
is waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Harry cheerfully.
Then he turned to Patience. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be
long, dear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Boland placed himself before his desk,
covertly watching from beneath his shaggy,
lowered brows until his son had disappeared.
Then he cleared his throat and wheeled upon
Patience without ceremony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen, Miss Welcome, you&#8217;re not
taking this seriously, I hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she replied, moving toward
the door. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to tell Harry how
impossible it is&mdash;that&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sensible girl,&#8221; he broke in bluntly.
&#8220;As it happens, Harry is already engaged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s breath came in short, sharp gasps,
but she managed to control her voice as she
murmured:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland placed his fingers in his vest pocket
and drew out a fountain pen, the point of
which he examined attentively. Patience felt
that she ought to go at once, but somehow she
couldn&#8217;t. She stood there trembling, scarcely
knowing whether or not she should believe the
other&#8217;s statement. She could not believe that
Harry would do such an ignoble thing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Boland glanced over his shoulder and saw
her still hesitating on the threshold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeated blandly. &#8220;He is going
to marry the daughter of my business partner&mdash;a
girl who will inherit half a million.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He could see from the corner of his eye
that the shot had told, but still Patience lingered,
dazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I see,&#8221; she faltered weakly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you go along like a good girl,&#8221;
advised Boland, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll see that you are
treated fairly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened a pretentious looking check book
which lay on the desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tell me how much you want and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; was the firm, decisive reply.
</p>
<p>He eyed the girl critically as he remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as though ready money were a
stranger to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;but I have a position with the
Mining Company in this building.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know them,&#8221; declared Boland thoughtfully.
Patience made no comment. She went
on proudly, drawing her figure to its full
height:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I want nothing; I am <i>giving</i> you back
your son, Mr. Boland, I am not selling him
to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and stared
stupidly at the vacant doorway as he heard
the girlish voice in the hallway, saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Down, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He closed his check book with a snap, and
involuntarily fumbled about his well arranged
desk, replacing a paper here and a contract
there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; he mused, &#8220;I thought there was
something wrong with Harry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The desk telephone rang sharply. He
picked up the instrument and placed the receiver
to his ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! hello!&#8221; he jerked out irritably.
&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, this is John Boland. Who
wants me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His acute features contracted as he listened
to the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Martin Druce,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Want to see
me about the lease of the Cafe Sinister, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mind worked rapidly while he again
listened.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he blustered finally, &#8220;all right,
see you in fifteen minutes. Yes,&mdash;yes, here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and took a cigar
from his pocket, thoughtfully biting off the
end, as he muttered half aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Druce, eh? Cafe Sinister&mdash;Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His lips ceased moving as he looked about
him. He was still thinking deeply; then he
struck a match and lighted the cigar at the
glowing flame which he contemplated for a
second before extinguishing it. With a look
of one who has just solved a problem, he cast
aside the charred ember and gritted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seized a sheet of paper and rapidly
scratched a few words on its white surface,
settling back comfortably in the big chair as
Harry came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Governor,&#8221; called out the son;
but he paused in astonishment when he saw
that his father was alone. &#8220;Why&mdash;why,
where&#8217;s Patience?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Welcome had to go,&mdash;she said,&#8221; returned
the other, calmly puffing his cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she leave any word for me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she said she&#8217;d see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; asked Harry, impatiently. &#8220;Why,
I don&#8217;t even know where she lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of that,&#8221; replied his father, as
he handed the memorandum slip to Harry, on
which he had just written. &#8220;Here&#8217;s her address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry took the bit of paper gratefully, and
looked at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; John Boland surveyed
the wrapper of his cigar with keen interest,
deftly closing a small broken place in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This address!&#8221; exclaimed Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in the lowest, most depraved section of
the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I noticed that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry looked up at his father quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor,&#8221; began Harry pointedly, a new
idea beginning to dawn upon him, &#8220;if you do
not know that a great deal of your property is
rented and used for the most immoral purposes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
how do you know this address so well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; spluttered Boland, senior, &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve
read the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this vile section of the city that you
own has never been published.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Harry,&#8221; demanded his father,
aggressively, &#8220;do you doubt my word?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; was the firm reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your father,&#8221; he retorted angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; agreed Harry, &#8220;but this is a
matter of right and wrong, and you can&#8217;t fool
me again as you have all these years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you who&#8217;s master,&#8221; threatened
John Boland, grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your privilege to try,&#8221; conceded the
son with suppressed anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on&mdash;hold on,&#8221; hedged his father,
apologetically, &#8220;don&#8217;t let&#8217;s get mad about it.
Finish up that contract and then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry&#8217;s manner was alert, defensive, but
wholly questioning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll talk this over calmly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but Governor&mdash;&#8221; the young man
turned at the door, grasping the contract in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
one hand as he put out the other warningly
and pointed with his forefinger to the scrap of
paper he had laid on the desk, on which was
written Patience&#8217;s supposed address: &#8220;Let
me give you a piece of advice. Don&#8217;t try to
fool me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Boland stood motionless for a moment
looking after his son; then he clenched
his hand and brought it down on the desk with
a forcible thump, as he thought:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do something&mdash;quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, made up your mind to see me, did
you, Mr. Boland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Martin Druce&#8217;s suave voice recalled Boland
from the revery into which he had lapsed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied quickly, walking to the
door through which Harry had gone and
closing it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t talk,&#8221; he commanded as he
returned to his desk. &#8220;Listen! You and
Anson want a renewal of the lease for the
Cafe Sinister, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded Druce, affably. &#8220;And I
suppose you&#8217;ll raise the rent on us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Boland, shaking his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you&#8217;re smart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you,&#8221; announced Druce inquiringly,
as he seated himself on the edge of the
desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, Harry, thinks he is in love with
a girl who has come to Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Boland, but I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Boland, regardless of
the interruption, &#8220;if Harry happened to see
this girl in some questionable resort,&mdash;say,
like Cafe Sinister&mdash;if he were tipped off that
this girl would be there&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you.&#8221; Druce sprang to his feet; he
was now keen and alert, like a hound on the
scent. &#8220;Who&#8217;s the girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a position of some kind with the
Alpha Mining Company on this floor,&#8221; replied
Boland. &#8220;She&#8217;ll lose that tomorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on. What&#8217;s her name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience Welcome!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Druce, with a sneering
twist to the word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Boland gazed at him, anxiously
awaiting the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About the lease?&#8221; veered Druce with cunning
perception.
</p>
<p>Boland hesitated and scrutinized the other
closely. He was satisfied with what he saw
stamped on Druce&#8217;s face, but he only said
pointedly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always make good when a man delivers
the goods. Now get out&mdash;I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On my way,&#8221; returned Druce easily, as he
sauntered to the door, but he turned there,
saying significantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll deliver the goods,&mdash;don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Boland sighed contentedly as he
watched Druce go. Then he muttered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, I guess I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Boland,&#8221; rang out a clear
feminine voice, as Miss Masters came from
the inner office. &#8220;That contract is all ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Masters!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she replied in saccharine
tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make out a lease for that property in
South Twelfth street.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For the Cafe Sinister, John?&#8221; inquired
Michael Grogan, who had followed Miss Masters
into the main office. &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up, Mike,&#8221; snapped Boland.
&#8220;What ails you, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading the last edition,&#8221; replied
Grogan, lugubriously. &#8220;Mary Randall has
had special officers sworn in at her own expense
to help her make raids. She&#8217;s put goose
flesh all over me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland took the paper which Grogan was
fingering nervously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; said the Irishman. &#8220;It&#8217;s a live
coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other glanced over the sheet and threw
it on the desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get busy on that lease, Miss Masters,&#8221; he
commanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment, Governor,&#8221; interrupted
Harry, who had overheard the conversation
as he came in. &#8220;If you lease that property to
that hound, Anson, you and I are through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed John Boland, astounded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It has come to a show-down,&#8221; went on
Harry, with determination expressed in both
his tone and manner, &#8220;and I&#8217;m damned if I&#8217;ll
touch a cent of dirty money like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been reading the Mary Randall
stuff, eh?&#8221; sneered his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And she&#8217;s right. Now, you make
your choice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on&mdash;hold on,&#8221; commanded the irate
father. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you forgetting that I own
and control this Lake City Company&mdash;that
you are&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I realize that,&#8221; retorted Harry,
resolutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; Boland turned to Miss Masters
grimly: &#8220;Make out that lease to Anson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here,&#8221; said Harry quietly, as he
wrote a few words on a sheet of blank paper
and laid it on the desk; &#8220;here is my resignation
as president of your Electrical Company, to
take effect <i>now</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; protested his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get my personal things together at
once,&#8221; went on the young man, securing his
hat from the rack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This has gone far enough,&#8221; rasped John
Boland, springing to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show this
Mary Randall there&#8217;s one she can&#8217;t scare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paced nervously up and down the office,
pausing finally beside his desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Masters, take an open letter from
me to the newspapers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not notice the actions of the stenographer
as he dictated:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, John Boland, am a business man. I
stand on my record. I defy Miss Mary Randall&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>In pausing to formulate his thoughts, he
became conscious that Miss Masters had not
been taking his dictation; that she had laid an
envelope on his desk directly in front of where
he usually sat, and that she was putting on
her hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, hold on!&#8221; he cried peremptorily.
&#8220;What does this mean, Miss Masters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means, Mr. Boland,&#8221; she replied quietly,
as she adjusted a hat pin, &#8220;that I have resigned.
Good day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she started to leave Boland called out
to her in amazement:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;wait&mdash;why do you resign?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That letter on the desk will tell you,&#8221; she
said as she moved through the doorway.
&#8220;Good day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Boland picked up the letter and
opened it. He was dazed as he read aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to lend my aid to the owners of
vice property. Mary Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland stared into space, while Harry
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Miss Masters is Mary Randall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder, alive!&#8221; yelled Grogan. He slid
down in his chair and attempted to conceal
himself beneath the desk.
</p>
<p>John Boland&#8217;s hands trembled as he
clutched the letter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Randall,&#8221; he said, still dazed. &#8220;By
all that&#8217;s holy! That girl Mary Randall!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE CAFE SINISTER</h3>
</div>

<p>The Cafe Sinister stands like a gilded
temple at the entrance to Chicago&#8217;s
tenderloin. The fact is significant. The management,
the appearance, the policy, if you
please, of the place are all in keeping with
this one potent circumstance of location. The
Cafe Sinister beckons to the passerby. It
appeals to him subtly with its music, its cheap
splendor, its false gayety. To the sophisticated
its allurements are those of the scarlet
woman, to the innocent its voice is the voice
of Joy.
</p>
<p>Two pillars of carved glass, lighted from
the inside by electricity, stand at the portal.
Within a huge room, filled with drinking tables
sparkling with many lights, gleaming and
garish, suggests without revealing the enticements
of evil.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>This is the set trap. Above is that indispensable
appurtenance to the pander&#8217;s trade&mdash;the
private dining room. Above that is
what, in the infinite courtesy of the police,
is called a hotel. And behind and beyond lies
the Levee itself&mdash;naked and unashamed,
blatantly vicious, consuming itself in the
caustic of its own vices.
</p>
<p>To the trained observer of cities the words:
&#8220;All hope abandon, ye who enter here,&#8221; are
written as plainly over the door of the Cafe
Sinister as if it were that other portal through
which Dante passed with Beatrice. But the
unlearned in vice cannot read the writing. By
thousands every year they enter joyously and
by thousands they are cast out into the Levee,
wrecked in morals, ruined in health, racked by
their own consciences.
</p>
<p>The Cafe Sinister is not an institution peculiar
to Chicago. Every great city in America
possesses one. It is the place through
which recruits are won to the underworld. It
is the entrance to the labyrinth where lost
souls wander. Viewed from its portal it is
the Palace of Pleasure; seen from behind,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
through those haggard eyes from which vice
has torn away the illusions of innocence, it is
the Saddest Place in the World.
</p>
<p>Druce owned the Cafe Sinister with Carter
Anson; their lease was written for them by
John Boland. Thus the upper world and the
under were leagued for its maintenance. And
though the press might shriek and the pulpit
thunder the combination and the Cafe Sinister
went on forever.
</p>
<p>These three men had been drawn together
by a common characteristic. Their consciences
were dead. That atrophy of conscience made
them all worshipers of the same idol&mdash;money.
The motives that propelled each of the three
to the altar were as diverse as their separate
natures, but the sacrifice that each offered to
the Moloch was the same&mdash;their souls.
</p>
<p>Having forfeited by their deeds the thing
that made them men, the three shrunk to the
moral stature of animals. Boland was the
tiger, brooding over the city with yellow eyes,
seeking whom he might devour. Druce was
the wolf; cunning, ruthless, prowling. Anson
was the mastiff; savage, brutal, given to wild
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
bursts of rending passion. Love of power
lashed Boland to his crimes; lechery prompted
Druce in his prowlings; and whisky was the
fire that smouldered under Anson&#8217;s brutalities.
</p>
<p>On an afternoon in June Druce and Anson
sat together in conference in one of the little
booths of the Cafe Sinister&#8217;s main dining
room. The cafe, after its orgy of the night
before, was quiet. Waiters, cat-footed and
villain faced, gathered up the debris of the
night&#8217;s revel, slinking about their work like
men ashamed of it. The sunlight peered dimly
through the curtained windows; the air was
heavy with the lees of liquor and the dead
smoke of tobacco.
</p>
<p>The two men sat facing each other. A glass
of whisky was cupped in Anson&#8217;s closed
hand. His clothes, unbrushed and unpressed,
flapped about his huge figure. His throat
bagged with flabby dewlaps. His head was
bullet-shaped, his eyes fierce, his mouth loose-lipped
and brutal. He made a strange contrast
to his companion. Druce was lithe, well
made and gifted with a sort of Satanic handsomeness.
He was immaculately dressed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fixed, I tell you,&#8221; Druce was saying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fixed, be damned,&#8221; rumbled Anson. &#8220;I
know Boland. Nothing&#8217;s fixed with him until
the lease is drawn and delivered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say the thing&#8217;s fixed,&#8221; insisted Druce.
&#8220;All we&#8217;ve got to do now is carry out our part
of the agreement and I&#8217;ve completed all of the
arrangements. We&#8217;ve got a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Anson, unconvinced. &#8220;It&#8217;s
fixed and you&#8217;ve completed the arrangements.
I&#8217;m from Missouri.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boland wants this girl, Patience Welcome,
brought in here next Saturday night,&#8221; said
Druce. &#8220;He has arranged that his pious pup
of a son, Harry, shall be here the same evening.
We are to manage it so that he will get
the impression that the girl has been amusing
herself with him, that she has been kidding
him along and playing this tenderloin game
on the side. He&#8217;s not to be allowed to talk
to her. He&#8217;ll see her&mdash;that will be enough.
She&#8217;s to come here to help her mother earn a
little cash. I sent a fellow to hire the old
woman to start here on Saturday night as a
scrub woman. She&#8217;s agreed to keep that part
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
of it quiet. Then I&#8217;ll drag the other one in&mdash;mine,
do you understand. We&#8217;ll make young
Boland think the whole damned Welcome
family belongs to us. We can see to it that
the Patience girl gets some glad rags and
some dope when she gets here. She&#8217;s seen me
in Millville, so it&#8217;s up to you, Anson, to sign
her up at good pay as a singer&mdash;&#8221; He stopped
significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too complicated,&#8221; was Anson&#8217;s rejoinder.
&#8220;Sounds good on paper, but it won&#8217;t work, I
tell you, it won&#8217;t work. I don&#8217;t like the way
things have been going lately.&#8221; He drained
the whisky glass. &#8220;This vice commission and
this crazy yap of a Mary Randall&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, hell!&#8221; interrupted Druce in disgust.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, too, have you? Mary Randall!
My God, you talk like an old woman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you&mdash;&#8221; Anson began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell me nothing. I&#8217;m sick and
tired of framing stuff and then have you
throw it down because you&#8217;ve lost your nerve
and are afraid of a girl. I&#8217;m done, I tell you.
If you think you can improve on my plans, go
ahead. I&#8217;m through. I won&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Anson capitulated immediately. &#8220;Now
don&#8217;t get sore, Mart,&#8221; he whined, &#8220;I know I&#8217;m
no good on this frameup stuff. Maybe I am
a little nervous. Go ahead with your plan&mdash;I
guess it&#8217;s the best one. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s fight
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; rejoined Druce. &#8220;Now that&#8217;s
settled. I&#8217;ll handle this thing. All you&#8217;ve
got to do is keep your trap shut and stand
pat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
angry and maudlin exclamations of a girl.
She had been sitting at a distant table half
asleep. A porter had wakened her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go home and sleep,&#8221; she shrieked.
&#8220;Keep your hands off me, you dirty nigger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; demanded Druce
of Anson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Swede Rose has been drunk all night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get rid of her. She&#8217;s always
pulling this rough stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; warned Anson. &#8220;It&#8217;s too hard
to get new girls. When she&#8217;s sober she&#8217;s a
wise money getter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn her,&#8221; muttered Druce, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
her anyway. She had the nerve to slap my
face the other night because I wouldn&#8217;t give
her money for hop. As soon as this lease is
signed I&#8217;m going down state. I&#8217;ll bring back
some new stock and then it&#8217;s &#8216;On your way&#8217;
for that wildcat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me handle her,&#8221; advised Anson. He
got up and walked over to the table where the
girl was having the altercation with the negro.
She was still young, but drink and drugs had
left ineffaceable lines upon her face. She was
beautiful, even this morning after her night&#8217;s
debauch, for she possessed a regularity of
feature and a fine contour of figure that not
even death itself could wreck. Her disheveled
hair showed here and there traces of gray.
Her skin was a dead white, save where two
pink spots blazed in either cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he comes,&#8221; called the girl, catching
sight of Anson. &#8220;Good old Carter. Ans,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;chase this coon out of here; he
won&#8217;t let me sleep.&#8221; Anson motioned the
porter to keep his distance. &#8220;An&#8217; say, Ans,&#8221;
the girl went on, &#8220;gimme a quarter. I&#8217;m broke
and I got to have some hop or die.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Anson handed the negro a quarter without
a word. The porter hurried out of the cafe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to chase me out,&#8221; the girl
whimpered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rose,&#8221; Anson went on pacifically,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve got to cut out this all night booze
thing. You&#8217;re hurting the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked up at the dive keeper with
dull eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurting the house, eh?&#8221; she echoed.
&#8220;What about me? Think I ain&#8217;t hurting myself?
Say, it&#8217;s got so I&#8217;d rather be drunk than
sober. I can&#8217;t stand to be sober. I always
start thinking. Some of these days you&#8217;ll
hear of me walking out of this place and making
a dent in the lake&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The negro returned with the drug. The
girl seized it with trembling hands. While the
two men stood and looked she drew a small
lancet from the bosom of her dress, inserted
its point under the skin of her white forearm
and drove a few drops of the drug into the
vein. The effect was instantaneous. She
laughed loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you get to bed,&#8221; ordered Anson.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bed, hell,&#8221; retorted the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said get to bed.&#8221; Anson glowered at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a big night tonight, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t give me no orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anson had held in his temper as long as he
was able. His fierce eyes twinkled and his
brutal mouth twitched. Without a word he
reached across the table, clutched the girl by
the throat and dragged her out of her seat.
He hurled her, half strangled, on the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he bellowed to some of his servitors,
&#8220;take this damn hell-cat out of here. Take
her up to the hotel. If she won&#8217;t go to bed,
throw her into the street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&mdash;&#8221; gasped the girl, struggling
to her feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk back to me,&#8221; roared Anson, &#8220;or
I&#8217;ll kill you. I&#8217;ll show you what you are and
who&#8217;s running this place.&#8221; Then to the
waiters: &#8220;Get her out of here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was dragged out of the room,
screaming and fighting. A wisp of curses
came back into the big room as she was lugged
up the stairs towards the hotel.
</p>
<p>Anson stood panting with anger. A mail
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
carrier entered and placed a letter in his hand.
He opened and read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Carter Anson: Take your choice.
Close the Cafe Sinister, or I&#8217;ll see that it is
closed. Mary Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big man flushed crimson with rage.
He tried to speak, but the words choked in his
throat. He crumpled the letter and hurled it
with a curse across the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Druce,&#8221; he bellowed.
</p>
<p>Druce hurried across the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw you beat her up. Why don&#8217;t
you let &#8217;em alone? You&#8217;ll kill one of them
some of these days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, not her. I mean the letter. Mary
Randall&mdash;she says she&#8217;s going to close us.&#8221;
A waiter recovered the letter and brought it
to Druce. He read it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, listen, are you turning yellow&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t yellow,&#8221; returned Anson, &#8220;but
this thing is getting my goat. You&#8217;re sure
about that lease?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&mdash;say, I thought we&#8217;d settled
that&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; pursued Anson, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this.
What have you done with this other girl&mdash;the
one you married? She&#8217;ll be getting us into a
row next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I married her, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about time she started earning
her bread. This Randall woman hasn&#8217;t got
me scared. You know why I married her.
Well, I&#8217;m going through with it. I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of his sentence died on his lips. A
girl scarcely more than a child came in from
the hotel entrance. She was dressed in a lacey
gown, a size too large for her. The slit skirt
displayed her slim ankles in pink silk stockings.
The French heeled shoes were decorated
with rhinestone buckles. In spite of this
outrageous dress she was still pretty. It was
Elsie Welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, kid,&#8221; said Druce, his manner changing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see you, Martin,&#8221; Elsie replied.
Druce noticed that she seemed deeply agitated.
There were signs of recently shed tears
on her cheeks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run along,&#8221; said Anson, seeing the
girl&#8217;s agitation. When he was gone Druce
drew the girl into a booth and demanded
sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you want and how did
you get here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came in a taxicab,&#8221; the girl answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A taxi, eh? Well, you&#8217;re learning. Who
paid for it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t paid for, Martin. I wanted to see
you and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s waiting outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce flushed angrily. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t play me for a boob. Get
someone else to pay your taxi bills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Martin, I thought&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce did not wait for the rest of the sentence.
With a muttered oath he rushed outside
and paid the waiting chauffeur.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what do you want?&#8221; he demanded
when he returned.
</p>
<p>Elsie looked at him piteously. &#8220;Martin,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stay in that place any
longer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t my aunt treat you all right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl burst out sobbing. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t your
aunt, Martin. She told me so herself. And
that flat&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you. I can&#8217;t say it. I never
knew until tonight.&#8221; Elsie clutched Druce&#8217;s
arm pleadingly. &#8220;Martin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a man
came into my room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce saw that the time had come for him
to lay his cards on the table. He folded his
arms and looked at the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he demanded coolly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had been drinking and&mdash;he took hold
of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Druce gazed at
the girl satirically. She quailed with sinking
heart under that look. She began sobbing
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me like that, Martin,&#8221; she
wailed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;or I shall go mad. I left
home to marry you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I married you, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Druce
sneered.
</p>
<p>Elsie attempted to control her voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That woman you call your aunt laughed
at me when I told her I was your wife. She
said I was a country fool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn her,&#8221; muttered Druce. &#8220;I&#8217;ll settle
with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl grasped Druce frantically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me she lied,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll go
crazy. Tell me she lied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she lied,&#8221; answered Druce glibly.
&#8220;See here, kid, it&#8217;s about time you began helping
to support the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie dried her tears. &#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve practiced my songs&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, the songs,&#8221; said Druce. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Martin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;don&#8217;t be so stand-offish. When a
man offers to buy you a bottle of wine, let
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce stopped her sharply. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t
begin that Millville Sunday school stuff,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;This is business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; Elsie spoke in a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. When a man&#8217;s got a wad of bills
and he&#8217;s willing to buy, string him along!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m your wife, Martin.&#8221; Elsie was
dead white and calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let that worry you. Go as far
as you like&mdash;or as far as he likes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl stood motionless, looking straight
before her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is that what you brought me here
for?&#8221; she asked with forced calmness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Why do you suppose I dressed you
up like that? Your stock in trade is your good
looks. Sell it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl drew herself up rigidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; she said. She started
toward the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will!&#8221; grated Druce, following her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll die first.
Good-by!&#8221; The door closed after her.
</p>
<p>Anson had returned to the room and had
witnessed the scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;there goes the first
move in your plan. You&#8217;ve lost that one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; Druce sneered in return.
&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t lose any sleep worrying about
that one. She ain&#8217;t got a dime. She&#8217;ll be
back.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE LEVEE</h3>
</div>

<p>So stupefied was Elsie Welcome by
her emotions as she fled from the Cafe
Sinister that it was not until her clothes were
drenched that she realized it had begun to
rain. Even then she did not halt and seek
shelter. Her numbed brain knew only one
thing&mdash;that she must get away from Druce
and the place of sin to which he had brought
her.
</p>
<p>Up to the time of her last interview with
her husband she had been living in a dream;
now that dream had turned into a nightmare.
But the nightmare, she at last realized, was
reality. The veil of deception Druce had
woven around her had been torn away by his
own brutal words. She had come to feel a
vague terror of the man. As for the Cafe
Sinister, her whole nature revolted against it.
</p>
<p>It was an hour before sunset. The sullen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
houses about her were beginning to show
signs of life. Here and there a door opened
and a man or woman stepped quickly out with
rapid glances up and down the street. There
was no loitering. They went their way
quickly, always with a half furtive look over
the shoulder.
</p>
<p>As the girl reached a corner she found at
last that she was too exhausted to go farther.
Her clothes dripped. She sought an entrance
way for shelter. A tall girl in a broad hat
with showy plumes was just coming out of
the door. She looked at Elsie&#8217;s tear stained
face and stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, girlie?&#8221; There was
sympathy in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. Can you tell me where this
number is?&#8221; She produced a card on which
Druce&#8217;s &#8220;aunt&#8221; at their last interview had
written the address of a woman from whom
she could get work.
</p>
<p>The tall girl glanced at the slip of paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just over there, two doors from that
corner,&#8221; she said. Elsie turned to cross the
street. The tall girl stood still regarding her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
thoughtfully. Suddenly she seemed to reach
a decision. She darted forward and stopped
Elsie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my business, kid,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but what do you want of Mother Lankee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie looked at her in surprise. &#8220;Why,&#8221;
she said pitifully, &#8220;I expect to get work
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the kind of work Mother
Lankee would ask you to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m willing to do anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything?&#8221; repeated the tall girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I&#8217;ve got to the point where I
can&#8217;t afford to be particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tall girl laid her hand on Elsie&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie Welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On South Tenth street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You come from down state?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s written all over you. What man
brought you here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question surprised Elsie and brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
back memory of her sorrows. She did not
answer. Her eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, kid,&#8221; said the tall girl, cheerfully,
&#8220;get hold of yourself. Now, listen! You
stay away from Mother Lankee. You&#8217;re hungry,
ain&#8217;t you, dearie? You come with me
and we&#8217;ll get something to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie was too tired to resist and, instinctively,
she trusted this tall girl with her assumption
of guardianship. Together they crossed
the street and entered the rear room of a
saloon. Three men sat near the entrance
playing cards. They looked at the two girls,
inspecting Elsie narrowly and nodding carelessly
at her companion. The girl took seats
at a distant table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want, Lou?&#8221; inquired one of
the men, getting up from the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you,&#8221; retorted Lou curtly. &#8220;Send
one of your waiters here with a plain lemonade,
a glass of milk and some of that beef
stew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Milk, eh?&#8221; said the man, &#8220;and lemonade.
On the wagon again, Lou?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along now,&#8221; returned the girl. &#8220;If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
you keep on asking questions someone is going
to tell you lies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man went into another room, spoke to
someone there and rejoined the card players.
In a few moments a negro waiter appeared
with the viands Lou had ordered.
</p>
<p>Elsie began to eat famishedly. The other
girl watched her approvingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, girlie,&#8221; she advised. &#8220;I know
how you feel. I&#8217;ve been hungry myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sipped her lemonade until Elsie had
finished. Then, as though it had not been
interrupted, she resumed the conversation
they had begun in the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same old game,&#8221; she said cynically.
&#8220;You came to Chicago because you loved him.
He strung you along&mdash;&#8221; Her glance fell on
Elsie&#8217;s wedding ring. &#8220;You fell for that &#8216;I
do take thee&#8217; thing. Then he shook you. Is
that right, girlie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head. A stupor due to the
food and the reaction from her nervous and
physical exhaustion came over her. She felt
too languid to grapple with the problem of
existence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>The tall girl arched her eyebrows in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t shake you? Then why&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do what he wanted me to do,&#8221;
murmured Elsie. She felt her face flushing
and she dropped her head. &#8220;He wanted me
to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other interrupted her sharply. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t say it&mdash;I know.&#8221; She gripped the
table in sudden anger. &#8220;One of these dogs&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie stared at her blankly. The old sense
of forlornness, of being alone and uncared
for, returned to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; she faltered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Druce,&#8221; gasped Elsie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Druce, eh?&#8221; replied the tall girl, as though
the name had opened a whole vista of understanding.
&#8220;Druce? Well, look out for him,
girlie. He&#8217;ll hound you from one end of the
town to the other until he gets you. That&#8217;s
his business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He always said he was a dealer in live
stock.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>The tall girl laughed scornfully. &#8220;Live
stock!&#8221; she jeered. &#8220;Did he get away with
that? Well, that&#8217;s what he is&mdash;a dealer in
human live stock, a trafficker in women, one
of the oldest professions in the world&mdash;and the
dirtiest. Live stock! That&#8217;s what he calls
girls like you and me&mdash;cattle!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a long moment Elsie sat staring at her
companion. The last prop of her faith in the
man who had married her was crumbling. She
could not give up this last illusion of Druce&#8217;s
faithfulness without a struggle. The blood
flamed to her cheeks and she started to her
feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; she cried in anguish.
</p>
<p>To her surprise, Lou made no reply. She
merely regarded her pityingly. This was the
last blow. Elsie burst into a flood of tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said Lou
gently. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for anyone who is decent
to believe that men can fall so low. Why,
nobody believes it! The men who run the city
government don&#8217;t believe it, the law makers
don&#8217;t believe it, the vice commission, doesn&#8217;t
believe it. The only people who believe it are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the people who, at their own bitter cost, know
it&mdash;and this girl Mary Randall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at me, kid,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I was
sold for $175. Sold, do you get that?
SOLD! And I came high. They buy and
sell &#8217;em in this district every day for fifty.
Yes, I was prime stock. They brought me up
here from Kentucky. Kentucky Lou, price
$175&mdash;a choice article.&#8221; She broke off, laughing
bitterly, and summoned a waiter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisky,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and be quick with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She waited until the waiter returned without
speaking. Then she tossed off the glass
of fiery liquid like a man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, resuming the conversation
abruptly, &#8220;let me tell you what you are up
against. You can&#8217;t go home, your pride won&#8217;t
let you. And if you wanted to go home you
haven&#8217;t the money. Druce has turned you
loose in this district to starve and when you&#8217;ve
starved enough you&#8217;ll come back to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will, girlie. You don&#8217;t know it
now, but I know it and Druce knows it. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
when you come back you&#8217;ll do as Druce wants
you to do, because you&#8217;ll know that if you don&#8217;t
you&#8217;ll have to starve again. It&#8217;s against
human nature to starve. You&#8217;ll go back to
him. And when you do and Druce is tired of
you he&#8217;ll sell you for what you are, cattle&mdash;his
kind of cattle!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; wailed Elsie. &#8220;Not that. Surely
in this great city there are places where a
friendless girl can find protection!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kentucky Lou laughed again but the laugh
contained no mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that too, kid,&#8221; she said more
gently. &#8220;And perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;if you
could find the right people and they believed
you they might help you. But they didn&#8217;t
help me. I went to one of these institutions
that advertise to help friendless girls. Yes,
I went to them. I had my baby in my arms.
And they began by shooting me full of questions
that I&#8217;d rather die than answer. And me
perishing for a kind word and a slap on the
back&mdash;just something to keep me fighting to
be good. They gave me tracts, and sermons
and advice. And then my baby died and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
didn&#8217;t care what happened. I guess I went
crazy after that. &#8216;It&#8217;s hell, anyway,&#8217; I says,
&#8216;so here goes.&#8217; And here I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While she spoke Kentucky Lou was fumbling
with her dress. Her hand reappeared in
a moment with a five dollar bill. She shoved
the bill into Elsie&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and go. Go as far
as you can. It&#8217;s all I can do for you and it
may save you. I think you&#8217;ll come back to
Druce but I&#8217;m taking a gambler&#8217;s chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took Elsie by the arm, half lifted the
stupefied girl to her feet and led her to the
door. Impelled by a terror which both blinded
and choked her Elsie fled into the gathering
darkness without even pausing to thank her
benefactor.
</p>
<p>Lou returned to the saloon and ordered
more whisky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lou,&#8221; inquired one of the men, &#8220;who&#8217;s
you&#8217;re friend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lou regarded the questioner calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; she replied, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a little lost
lamb turned loose in a den of you human
hyenas.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>MARY RANDALL GOES TO LIVE IN A WOLF&#8217;S DEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Martin Druce, still pacing uneasily;
about the big drinking room of the Cafe
Sinister after his angry parting with Elsie
Welcome, looked up suddenly and saw the
street door open. He stood still staring. The
new arrival was Mary Randall. She wore a
smart tailored suit and a modish hat. Druce
noted these details of costume, the shining
bronze hair, the fresh complexion and the trim
figure. He gasped with surprise.
</p>
<p>Druce&#8217;s surprise was not due to any recognition
of his visitor as the reformer. To him
Mary Randall was still Miss Masters, for he
had heard nothing of the episode in John
Boland&#8217;s office when the electric king&#8217;s private
secretary revealed her true identity. His
astonishment was predicated upon the fact
that this stenographer, after having thwarted
and flouted him, after having seemed to read
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
the darkest secrets of his plotting mind, should
now walk in upon him with all the easy composure
of an old friend.
</p>
<p>Then he had read the girl wrong after all!
She was, as he had at first suspected, of the
demi-monde. Thus her sophistication, the
ease with which she had penetrated his pretensions,
the cool finality with which she had
catalogued and placed him, were all explainable.
Her worldly wisdom, which he had
found so baffling, was that of the skilled and
experienced adventuress!
</p>
<p>These reflections swept through his mind in
a moment. Another thought came to him that
filled him with rage. She was here now to
resume her play with him. But rage gave way
to desire. His mind instantly busied itself
with new intrigues. Here was a woman much
to be desired. She had come hunting amusement
at his expense. She delivered herself
into his hands; she laughed at his power. And
she seemed confident of beating him. This
was a game that filled him with delight. He
sprang forward eagerly to greet her, bowing
gallantly, and doffing his hat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Druce?&#8221; inquired
Miss Masters. &#8220;You seem surprised to see
me here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce caught something mocking in her
tone. &#8220;I&#8217;m more than surprised,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tickled pink. Won&#8217;t you have a seat?&#8221;
He prepared a place for her at one of the
booths. &#8220;And can&#8217;t I order you something to
drink?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters favored Druce with one of
her enigmatical smiles. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little early for
wine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and too late for highballs.
Besides, business before pleasure. I want to
talk to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce sat down, expectantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come here, Mr. Druce,&#8221; Miss Masters
went on, &#8220;not merely to make a social call, as
you seem to take for granted, but as John
Boland&#8217;s agent. He has instructed me to take
up the matter of your new lease with you. I
am to handle the whole transaction in his name.
The only stipulation that he makes is that you
are not to communicate with him again. He
wants you to stay away from his office, because
he has learned within the last few hours that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
the office is being watched by agents of this
girl reformer, Mary Randall. He has instructed
me to tell you not to attempt to see
him or to telephone him until your negotiations
with me are concluded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce was disappointed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I thought the matter of
the lease was settled. Boland told me plainly
when I last talked with him that if I would
arrange to have Patience Welcome here on
Saturday night so that Harry Boland could
see her he would give me a new lease with no
increase in rental.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; replied Miss Masters to
whom this was news. &#8220;The idea of arranging
this meeting is, I am informed, to convince
Harry that the girl has been playing with him&mdash;that
she is one of your employes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; replied Druce. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made all
the plans and the girl will be here on Saturday
night. I&#8217;ve arranged to have her mother here,
too. And to make it good I expect to bring
in the other sister&mdash;the girl Elsie&mdash;at the last
moment. Young Boland will believe that the
whole Welcome family is working for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Miss Masters. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty
smooth scheme, but Mr. Boland thinks it&#8217;s
rather too daring. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s sent me
here, to see that nothing goes wrong. You are
to give me all the details of your plans and
through me Mr. Boland is to be kept informed
as to what is going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a deep one,&#8221; said Druce. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like his introducing a third party into
my plans very well, but I guess I&#8217;ve got to
take it. I&#8217;ve got to have that lease.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Masters, &#8220;that&#8217;s the
way John Boland has it figured out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, girlie,&#8221; Druce went on, assuming a
confidential air, &#8220;Old Boland sure must have
a lot of confidence in you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Miss Masters smiled enigmatically.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;Mr. Boland has reason
to know I can take care of myself in nearly
every situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to think you&#8217;re as deep as
Boland is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Miss Masters tantalized him with
another of her smiles. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she went on,
&#8220;tell me about this. You say you&#8217;re going to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
have the other Welcome girl here. How do
you expect to arrange that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce grinned triumphantly. &#8220;That&#8217;s dead
easy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You see I&#8217;m married to her.&#8221;
He had expected to startle Miss Masters with
this information, but he was disappointed. She
merely arched her brows slightly.
&#8220;Then you marry them, do you?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, when I have to. It&#8217;s the easiest way.&#8221;
&#8220;Then this girl&mdash;Elsie&mdash;is living in your&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;hotel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Druce hesitatingly, &#8220;she&#8217;s
gone away.&#8221; Then he added quickly, &#8220;but she&#8217;ll
be back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone away? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, we had a family row this morning. I
told her that if she wanted to get along in
Chicago she&#8217;d have to discard her Millville
morals and be a good fellow. She&#8217;s squeamish.
I let her understand that she&#8217;d have to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Miss Masters. &#8220;She thought
that, because she was your wife she wouldn&#8217;t
have to drink with the patrons in your cafe.
When you told her she&#8217;d have to, she got
angry and walked out. Is that it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wise,&#8221; replied Druce admiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say she&#8217;ll be back. How do you know
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, because she hasn&#8217;t got a dime.
With her it&#8217;s a case of coming back or starving
to death in the Levee, and I know enough
about her to be sure she&#8217;ll be back. She can&#8217;t
get away from me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other girl, Patience?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks this is a sort of a music hall.
She&#8217;s coming here with her mother Saturday
night. Before she discovers that this place isn&#8217;t
exactly what she believes it is, Harry Boland
will see her up there on the stand with the
rest of my talent. I&#8217;ll get the girl out of the
place before he can talk to her. That will put
the kibosh on their love affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you expect to do with these girls
afterward?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we have facilities here&#8221;&mdash;Druce&#8217;s smile
was evil&mdash;&#8220;for breaking &#8217;em in. Afterward&mdash;well,
I don&#8217;t know. It may be dangerous to
keep them around Chicago. I can get a good
price for them.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;You know
I&#8217;m a dealer in live stock.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, you expect to sell them. That&#8217;s
not a bad idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, kid,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
asked me a lot of questions and got fair
answers. It&#8217;s a poor game that can&#8217;t be
played both ways. I want to know something
about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters curled herself up comfortably
in a corner of the booth. She looked challengingly
at Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my name. It&#8217;s Masters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that. What are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters replied quickly, &#8220;I&mdash;why&mdash;I&#8217;m
a girl, and&mdash;you say yourself I&#8217;m wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to tell me that. Where did
you come from? Where did Boland get you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I went to work for Boland I was
in St. Louis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shan&#8217;t answer that question&mdash;yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you seem to know a great deal about
the kind of business I&#8217;m in. Where did you
get your information?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Picked it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In St. Louis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I learned some things there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been in this business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this cafe business&mdash;and the rest
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say I know a good deal about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you know a lot about it. And you&#8217;ve
got your information from the inside. And
Boland knows you know a lot about it. Otherwise
he wouldn&#8217;t have sent you down here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Miss Masters was silent for a moment.
&#8220;Druce,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;did you ever
hear of the Broughton Club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that swell joint in St. Louis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Well, I&#8217;m interested in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that. I&#8217;m interested in
it and one of my reasons for calling on you
is to get some girls for the club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to buy some girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From you, if I can get the right figures.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
If I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll try elsewhere. You&#8217;re not the
only &#8216;dealer in live stock&#8217; in the Levee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make the figures right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Cafe Sinister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I want to know something about your
methods. We don&#8217;t know it all in St. Louis.
I think I can pick up a little information here.
I&#8217;m going back to St. Louis in a month. I
want to take some girls back with me, and I&#8217;d
like to find out just how a first class joint like
the Cafe Sinister is operated in Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this a proposition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a proposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to live at the Cafe Sinister during
the week our deal for the lease is on. I&#8217;ll take
rooms in your&mdash;a&mdash;hotel, upstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be around the cafe, and making
myself at home generally,&#8221; added Miss Masters,
reassuringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as far as you like,&#8221; answered Druce,
&#8220;and if you need a body guard,&#8221; he added,
with a knowing wink, &#8220;why, you know
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Miss Masters&#8217; eyes narrowed. &#8220;I told you
I could look out for myself,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to look out for yourself,&#8221;
retorted Druce significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me do the worrying about that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce was silent. He had determined to
accept Miss Masters&#8217; offer. He felt that she
was walking into his trap and yet, so great had
grown his respect for her that he did not know
his next move.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a suite prepared for you,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s settled, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters got up from her seat. As she
did so Druce attempted a caress. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to collect part of the rent in advance,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; Miss Masters pushed him
away sharply. He did not repeat his indiscretion.
Instead he stood back respectfully to
let her pass. In the palm of her hand with
the muzzle pointing firmly in his direction he
saw a small, steel-blue magazine pistol. The
girl&#8217;s finger was on the trigger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll have one of your servants show
me the suite,&#8221; said Miss Masters, &#8220;I&#8217;ll telephone
for my maid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>Then she added, seemingly as an afterthought,
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never pay the rent, Mr. Druce, until the
end of the week.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>DRUCE SIGNS A SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Mary Randall realized that she
was playing a dangerous game. She
had placed herself in Druce&#8217;s power because
taking that risk had seemed to her the best
way to gather evidence against the Cafe Sinister.
She had not acted without laying her
plans carefully. Her whole campaign for the
week that she was to be in Druce&#8217;s dive had
been mapped out before she set foot so unexpectedly
inside his door.
</p>
<p>The girl depended upon two things for protection.
First was Druce&#8217;s fear of the power
of John Boland. She believed that the man
would not dare to use physical violence against
her if he thought she was what she had represented
herself to be&mdash;John Boland&#8217;s agent.
Second was his desire for a renewal of the
lease to the cafe. Mary was confident that
Druce would plot against her but she was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
equally sure he would not move until after the
lease had been signed. If both these protections
failed, she still had her magazine pistol.
And she knew how to use it.
</p>
<p>In coming into Druce&#8217;s place she had deliberately
counted on the ascendancy which she
knew her beauty and her air of mystery had
obtained over him. She was playing the
pander at his own game. It was an extremely
dangerous game but she believed she could
beat him. And the results would be worth the
risk.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile her greatest anxiety was to prevent
Druce from communicating in any way
with John Boland. If Druce should learn
through Boland that he had not delegated her
to negotiate the lease, that she was in fact
Mary Randall, then she would be face to face
with a fight for her life. But she was quite
sure that Druce would not communicate with
Boland. She knew the workings of Boland&#8217;s
office well enough to understand how difficult
it was for Druce to get a word with the master
of the Electric Trust and as a special precaution
she had put an inhibition upon him not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to call at or telephone to the office. Finally,
before she had quite finished with Boland, she
had arranged with his telephone operator that
no calls from Druce should be put on John
Boland&#8217;s wire.
</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s first move after she had been shown
to her suite was to telephone to Anna, her
maid, whom she had left nearby before making
her visit to the cafe. Anna arrived in a short
time with a porter carrying a couple of heavy
suit cases.
</p>
<p>When the two girls were at last alone in
their rooms they began preparing for their
week&#8217;s stay by making a thorough examination
of the locks on the doors. They found
them secure. Then, closing the keyholes, they
proceeded to unpack the suit cases. Out of
them they took, besides various articles of
apparel, a complete dictagraph apparatus.
The transmitter was hidden under a mat on a
table in the reception room that formed part
of the suite. The wires were carried down the
leg of the table and under the carpets to a
small closet; there Anna installed a small table,
a pocket electric light and her stenographer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
notebook. A small camera was hidden in one
of the window curtains. It was focused so as
to take in the space surrounding the table in
the reception room. When one of the curtains
was raised the plate was automatically exposed
and the raising of the curtain at the same time
let enough light into the room to take an excellent
picture.
</p>
<p>With these arrangements completed, Mary
began a tour of the cafe building. She found
Druce eager to serve her. By him she was
guided to every part of the place, meeting the
people she wanted to know and learning all of
the details of the infamous business in which
Druce, Anson and Boland were jointly embarked.
For three days she went about these
tours of inspection undisturbed. In the evenings
she had the women habitues of the place
in her rooms, talking to them as if she were
one of their own kind and learning from them
the squalid stories of their downfall and the
part Druce and Anson had played in it.
Anna was not in sight during any of these interviews.
She was seated at the little table
with the dictagraph at her ear, her fountain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
pen in her hand and her stenographer&#8217;s notebook
before her. Nothing that was said
escaped her.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Druce was having an unpleasant
time with Anson. He had tried at first to
keep from him the fact of Miss Masters&#8217; residence
in their &#8220;hotel.&#8221; &#8220;The mastiff,&#8221; however,
was not long deceived. When he confronted
Druce with what he had learned,
Druce with an assumption of frankness told
him of his interview with Miss Masters and
attempted to reassure him.
</p>
<p>Anson, however, was by nature suspicious.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;You&#8217;ve let a
spy into the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce tried at first to argue with him. Then
he grew angry. Finally he turned on his
partner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mind your own business,&#8221; he advised
him, white with rage. &#8220;I&#8217;ll manage this thing.
The girl&#8217;s mine. I&#8217;m going to have her.
Keep away from her. By God, if you interfere
with my schemes I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anson was not terrified by this threat. He
knew that in any physical encounter he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
more than a match for the slender Druce. But
he feared to quarrel with his partner. He
was too appreciative of Druce&#8217;s value to him
and their enterprise to want to lose him. He
growled a smothered string of curses, but
Druce had his way.
</p>
<p>Druce had become so much infatuated with
Miss Masters that he had thrown caution to
the winds. Never before in his life had he
been under the influence of any woman. Now
that such an influence had seized him he was
overwhelmed by it. He had arrived perilously
close to the point where, if he had known the
true character of the woman he was sheltering,
his infatuation would have led him to risk the
danger merely to have her near him. His
thoughts were on her constantly, his mind
busy during every waking hour on schemes for,
entrapping her.
</p>
<p>Mary had taken up her abode in the Cafe
Sinister on Monday. On Thursday she sent
for Druce. He came to her suite eagerly.
</p>
<p>He found Miss Masters sitting at the table
in the reception room. He sat down opposite
her and facing the window at her invitation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Druce,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;I&#8217;ve sent for you
because I want to close that deal for the girls
I spoke to you about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls you&#8217;re going to take back to St.
Louis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll want five or six.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been looking over my stock?&#8221; said
Druce with a leer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Masters, concealing
her repulsion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we can come to terms. Who
do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only care for four of the girls I have
seen,&#8221; replied Miss Masters. &#8220;I want that
little girl, Maida, the blonde girl you call
Luella, Clara, and that young brunette,
Esther.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;you don&#8217;t want much,
do you? Why those are the youngest and
prettiest girls we&#8217;ve got in the place. That
Luella has only been in the district three
weeks. All the rest of them are new ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. That&#8217;s why I want them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll cost you money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to pay money for them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want $200 apiece for those four girls.&#8221;
The price was high. Druce thought Miss
Masters would reject it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; returned Miss Masters. &#8220;That
will be $800.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re willing to pay it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m going to spend $1,000 with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four ain&#8217;t enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to take two more, if I can
get them. You say you expect to have these
Welcome sisters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll have them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you told me you didn&#8217;t want to run
the risk of keeping them around Chicago. I&#8217;ll
take them off your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You expect to get them for $200?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. You don&#8217;t know yet that you
can deliver. Has the one you married come
back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as sure of that as you are, but I&#8217;m
willing to speculate on it. I&#8217;ll make you this
proposition. I&#8217;ll write you a check for $1,000
and take my chance on you delivering the six
girls I name.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No checks go,&#8221; said Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take a check if you do business
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce considered. He wanted the $1,000.
He did not want to quarrel with Miss Masters.
He capitulated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Write the check,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters took a check-book from a
drawer and drew a check, payable to Druce.
She handed it to him. He looked at the paper
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to indorse that,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Miss Masters laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to indorse
it unless you want to keep it as a souvenir.&#8221;
She smiled at him. &#8220;Druce,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
never get along in this business if you&#8217;re a
coward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s direct evidence against me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t trust me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, girlie. I&#8217;ll trust you.&#8221; He
folded the check and put it in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll have to have a bit of writing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No writing for mine,&#8221; retorted Druce.
&#8220;This check is plenty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Druce,&#8221; Miss Masters spoke
appealingly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair, do
you? You&#8217;ve got my check.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s you that&#8217;s not trusting me
now,&#8221; said Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you admit yourself that you may not
deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No I don&#8217;t. I will deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way we do this kind of business
in Chi.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Masters got up from the table, as if
exasperated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Druce,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How
can signing an agreement covering this sale
hurt you? Oh, what a lot of cowards you &#8216;live
stock dealers&#8217; are! Can&#8217;t you see that if you
sign this agreement with me I&#8217;m incriminated
as well as you are? The Mann act gets the
buyer as well as the seller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the agreement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It says simply this: &#8216;In consideration of
$1,000 I agree to deliver two days from date
the following girls&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;ll write in their names&mdash;&#8216;to
Miss Masters.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not trying to put anything over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it ever strike you that by selling these
girls to me you&#8217;d have John Boland where
you wanted him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m his agent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Druce snatched up the paper
and read it. &#8220;Write in the names.&#8221; Miss
Masters wrote the names of six girls into the
document. She handed it back to Druce and
picked up a pen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; she said, giving him the
pen. &#8220;It&#8217;s dark here. I&#8217;ll raise the curtain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stepped quickly across the room and
adjusted the curtain so that the sunlight fell
full across Druce as he signed his name to the
agreement. As he finished the last stroke he
heard a faint &#8220;click.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; he demanded anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The curtain caught on the window latch,&#8221;
replied Miss Masters. She picked up the
agreement and blotted the signature. &#8220;Thank
you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;now I&#8217;ve got something for
my $1,000.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce laughed uneasily. The maid, Anna,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
entered from an adjoining apartment. Druce
realized uncomfortably that the interview was
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, going to the door and
smiling sentimentally at Miss Masters, &#8220;so
long. See you later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Masters in a tone he
didn&#8217;t just like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>DRUCE PROVES A TRUE PROPHET</h3>
</div>

<p>Saturday night begins at the Cafe
Sinister at nine o&#8217;clock. At that hour
the twin columns of glass at its portal are
lighted and the Levee pours the first of its
revelers into the spacious ground floor drinking
room. The orchestra strikes up the first
of its syncopated melodies; the barkeepers
arrange their polished glasses in glittering
rows; the waiters, soft-footed and watchful,
take their places at their appointed stations.
</p>
<p>The revelers come in an order regulated by
inexorable circumstance. In the van are the
women with the professional escorts, haggard
creatures who have served their time in the
district and who are on the brink of that
oblivion which means starvation and slow
death. Youth and health have flown and now
no paint nor cosmetic can cloak their real
character. They must come early because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
their need of money is bitter and a watchful
eye for opportunity must take the place of the
physical allurement that once made life in the
tenderloin so easy. They sink into their seats
and wait, contemptuous of their escorts, and
yet pitifully dependent upon them. For
without the escorts they cannot enter the Cafe
Sinister. That is a tribute which the rulers
of the tenderloin, through them, pays tribute
to the majesty of the law.
</p>
<p>A group of hardened rounders follows.
These are men to whom the Cafe Sinister and
the district have become a habit. They bring
with them women of their own kind&mdash;women
who, through years of dissipation, have still,
like misers, managed to hoard some trace of
bloom. They drink deeply, for the men are
spenders. The wine flows free and the talk
grows loud. Occasionally a man quarrels
profanely with his companion and a soft-footed
waiter with a thug&#8217;s face whispers him
to sullen silence.
</p>
<p>An hour flies by. Now the Levee, roused
from its sodden, day-long slumber, is wide
awake. The way between the twin pillars at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
the Cafe Sinister&#8217;s entrance is choked with
the flood of merry-makers. These newcomers
are not so easy to classify as their predecessors.
They are the crowd from the street,&mdash;the thief
with his girl pal, eager to spend the plunder of
their last successful exploit; the big corporation&#8217;s
entertainer, out to show a party of
country customers the sights of a great city;
the visitor from afar, lonely and seeking
excitement; the man about town, the respectable
woman who with a trusted male confidant
seeks shady and clandestine amusement; college
students with unspoiled appetites off for
a lark; women of the district still new enough
to the life of vice to find pleasure in its excitements;
periodical drinkers out for a night of
it; clerks, cashiers, bookkeepers, schoolboys
and roués.
</p>
<p>And here and there, weaving in and out
through this heterogeneous mob lurks the
pander seeking for his prey&mdash;the ignorant
young girl, trembling on the verge of her first
step into the depths, the little lost sister of
tomorrow.
</p>
<p>By ten o&#8217;clock the merry making in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Cafe Sinister had attained the vociferousness
of a riot. As the swift-footed waiters passed
more and more liquor about, the voices of the
speakers rose higher and higher. At last the
orchestra itself could scarcely be heard. The
singers, half maudlin themselves, and knowing
they could not be heard above the universal
din, abandoned harmony and resorted to
shouts and suggestive gyrations. A woman
fell helplessly into the arms of her escort who,
gloating, winked knowingly at a male companion.
Another drunkenly attempted to
dance and was restrained by the waiters. An
elderly reprobate, convoying two unsteady
young girls, importuned Druce for one of his
private dining rooms.
</p>
<p>Druce and Anson watched over the revelers
and directed the entertainers. &#8220;The Mastiff,&#8221;
comfortably full of his favorite liquor, whisky,
glowered on the crowd with as near an aspect
of good nature as he was able to muster.
Druce, who knew his own success in business
was due to alertness of mind and who was
almost an ascetic in the matter of drink, was
no less at peace with the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Money in that crowd,&#8221; rumbled the huge
Anson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Druce, &#8220;business is mighty
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about our lease?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blow-off comes tonight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure of your plans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, if young Boland shows up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll be here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I wrote him an anonymous letter
telling him if he wanted to see his girl, he could
find her singing at the Cafe Sinister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ought to fetch him. How about the
old man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sent me word today that he&#8217;d be here
and that he&#8217;d dropped hints to the son he&#8217;d
heard some bad stuff about the girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t talked to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I got my orders. I stayed away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the Welcome kid you married?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s down and out. I sent one of our
cappers early in the week to look her up.
Somebody&#8217;d slipped her a lone five dollar bill.
She woke up yesterday morning broke. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
don&#8217;t know where she&#8217;s eating, but I&#8217;ve sent
word through the district to keep her hungry.
She&#8217;ll be in tonight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce spoke with indifference, but the
truth was that he was not at all sure that
Elsie Welcome would return. He had begun
to respect the girl&#8217;s strength of character. He
had scarcely finished his sentence when he
gave a gasp of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-h!&#8221; he muttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Anson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she comes now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they looked down through the drinking
room they saw the slender figure of a girl
approaching. She came slowly, supporting
her wavering steps with the backs of the
revelers&#8217; chairs. Her face was pale and
desperately haggard. Several of the men as
she passed clutched at her skirts and shouted
invitations at her. She tore herself away from
them and made straight for the place where
Druce and Anson were standing. For a moment,
Druce almost felt sorry for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re back, kid?&#8221; he said softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl, fiercely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie burst out sobbing. It was her last
struggle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, Elsie,&#8221; Druce spoke almost
tenderly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t snivel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; the girl gasped appealingly.
&#8220;O, my God! Be kind to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, girlie. You forget
that Sunday school stuff and you&#8217;ll get along
with me fine. You&#8217;re hungry, aren&#8217;t you,
kid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starving,&#8221; replied the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me. I&#8217;ll have the chef get you
a big feed. After that I want you to come
back and do what I tell you. I won&#8217;t be hard
on you, kid. You&#8217;ll not have to work tonight.
All I&#8217;ll want you to do is sit up on the stand
with my other entertainers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie was too broken in spirit to reply. She
followed her master dumbly. He led her to
one of his small private dining rooms, arranged
a seat for her and turned on the lights.
Then he went back to the kitchen to order the
girl&#8217;s meal.
</p>
<p>After Druce had left, Elsie folded her arms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
on the table and cushioning her head on them,
began to weep softly. Druce returned with
the food, kissed her to take the sting from the
feed, which both he and she knew was the
price of her shame, and left her. The girl ate
ravenously. Afterward she fell into an uneasy
slumber against the cushions of the booth.
</p>
<p>She was awakened by someone entering
the room. Looking up, she saw the bowed
figure and gray hair of an elderly woman.
The intruder carried a bucket of hot water in
one hand and a mop in the other. She had
come into the booth thinking it unoccupied,
and did not see Elsie until she was very close
to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; she said, dropping
her mop and bucket and starting back.
</p>
<p>Elsie stared at her. Then she stood up, her
face pale as death, her eyes starting like the
eyes of one who has seen a vision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;Oh, God!
Mother!&#8221; and flung herself into her mother&#8217;s
arms.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE MILLS OF THE GODS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>After Druce left Elsie he went back to
his favorite station behind the musicians&#8217;
stand. He had been there only a
moment when he saw the elder Boland enter.
Boland came in quietly through a side door
and stood looking about inquiringly.
</p>
<p>Druce silently summoned a waiter and
sent him to Boland with a message. A little
later the two men were in Druce&#8217;s private
office alone and the door was closed. They sat
down at a table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Druce, &#8220;I see you&#8217;re on time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Boland coldly. &#8220;I make it
a point to keep my engagements. Your
arrangements are complete, I suppose. I
haven&#8217;t heard a word from you all week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a petulance in his tone the reason
for which Druce did not comprehend.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to work out all right. One of
the Welcome girls is here now. I&#8217;m expecting
the other.&#8221; He pushed an electric button. A
waiter appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go out and ask the professor if that new
entertainer I&#8217;m expecting has arrived,&#8221; he
ordered.
</p>
<p>The waiter was gone but a few seconds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s come,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;She&#8217;s up on
the stand and will go on right after the intermission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her,&#8221; said Druce to Boland. The
waiter vanished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Boland. &#8220;Druce,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased with the way you&#8217;ve handled
this. Here&#8217;s something to prove it.&#8221; He took
a document from his breast pocket and passed
it across the table. It was the lease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Druce, keenly pleased by
an inspection of the papers, &#8220;that looks good
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours,&#8221; returned Boland, &#8220;but of
course I expect you to carry out your part of
the contract.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Harry?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No need to worry about that. He&#8217;ll be
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re waiting on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause. Neither man seemed to
know how to continue the conversation.
Druce broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boland,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what have you got
against this girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland resented the question, but was compelled
to answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She wants to marry my son. I don&#8217;t think
she&#8217;s fit to marry him. If she were, she
wouldn&#8217;t be in a place like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce laughed unpleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;that she
wouldn&#8217;t be here if I hadn&#8217;t managed it for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland made no reply for this. Druce
went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;on the square,
now, is that all you&#8217;ve got against this girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that, Druce?&#8221;
demanded Boland, eying him calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know the Welcomes before this
girl came into your son&#8217;s life?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>Boland turned very pale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an idiotic question,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;How would a man in my position know
people like the Welcomes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was in Millville,&#8221; replied Druce
evenly, &#8220;I heard a good deal about old Tom
Welcome. It seems that someone stole an
invention from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just why should I be interested in that
story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Druce. &#8220;It just
struck me that you might be. There was no
harm in asking, was there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland ignored the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, changing the subject,
&#8220;suppose you get this lease from me, are you
sure you can continue doing business as you
are without police interference?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce laughed and picked up the receiver
of the telephone which stood on the table.
There was an attachment that enabled Boland
to hear at the same time. He handed the
second receiver to the master of the Electric
Trust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; inquired Boland.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to answer your question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He called for a number.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s police station R,&#8221; said Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; replied Druce, &#8220;just listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;is this you,
Cap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland heard a familiar voice answer
affirmatively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Druce talking,&#8221; the dive-owner
went on, &#8220;Druce of the Cafe Sinister. Say,
we&#8217;ll be open all night tonight. Don&#8217;t make
any trouble for us, you understand. Just let
your fellows know that they&#8217;re not to hear
anything that goes on in this beat. I&#8217;ll send
McEdwards around in the morning with a
special envelope for you. Get me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce cut off the two telephones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he asked triumphantly, &#8220;what do
you think of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland laughed cynically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather good,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I know
your friend, the captain. The fact is, I know
him rather well. We belong to the same
church.&#8221; He chuckled over his own joke.
&#8220;However,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t come here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
to be entertained, nor to be initiated into the
mysteries of the police department. Let&#8217;s get
down to business. I&#8217;ve got to get out of town
tonight. I&#8217;m going to &#8217;Frisco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To &#8217;Frisco?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m in a mess. Mary Randall&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randall! Boland, don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re
scared of that woman, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man alive, haven&#8217;t you heard? She got
into my office in disguise and stole a lot of my
papers. I don&#8217;t know just yet what she&#8217;s got,
but I&#8217;ve decided to hunt seclusion for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was disguised?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she came into my office as private
secretary. I trusted her implicitly. You&#8217;ll
remember her. She gave the name of Miss
Masters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Druce stood up with an exclamation. His
face had gone white and he clutched at the
table for support. Boland stared at him in
astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s hit you?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>Druce made no reply. Through his mind
was passing the panorama of how he had delivered
himself bound hand and foot to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
girl he thought he was entrapping. Suddenly,
he turned and dashed in a frenzy out of the
room. He was bound, with murder in his
heart, for Miss Masters&#8217; suite.
</p>
<p>As he came tearing out of the office he
found himself suddenly seized and halted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; screamed Druce, &#8220;damn you,
let me go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fought to release himself, but vainly.
He looked up into the face of Harry Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your hurry?&#8221; inquired young
Boland coolly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be in a rush. I want
to ask you a few questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He produced a letter from his pocket.
Druce recognized it at a glance as the
anonymous note he had written to lure young
Boland to the cafe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you write that?&#8221; demanded Boland.
</p>
<p>Druce struggled in a frenzy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To hell with you and your questions,&#8221; he
yelled. &#8220;Let me by or I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He grappled with Boland and the two men
wrestled out to the edge of the big drinking
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wrote it,&#8221; Boland hissed in his ear.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie. I&#8217;m going to give you the beating
of your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The elder Boland, who had followed Druce,
fell upon his son. Harry turned and recognized
his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You here?&#8221; he demanded, facing his
parent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied John Boland, &#8220;I&#8217;m here. I
came, because I had been informed that you
were to meet a woman of the tenderloin in
this place; and when I find you, I find you
fighting with a dive-keeper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry dropped the struggling Druce and
turned on his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked, defiantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just that,&#8221; replied John Boland.
He turned toward the musicians&#8217; stand and
pointed dramatically at Patience Welcome,
who, her face almost as pale as her white lace
gown, was advancing toward the front of the
platform to sing.
</p>
<p>Harry Boland&#8217;s face went white as hers.
</p>
<p>The words he gasped were drowned by a cry,
Elsie Welcome, coming for the first time since
her return to Druce into the drinking room,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
saw her sister standing upon the rostrum,
poised to sing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience! Patience!&#8221; she screamed in a
voice of despair. &#8220;Oh, my sister, what
brought you to this place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She fell to the floor fainting. The whole
cafe was in an uproar.
</p>
<p>Carter Anson, roused to fury by the disturbance,
fought his way through the crowd
to the place where he had seen her fall.
</p>
<p>Druce, escaped from Harry Boland,
struggled from another angle to make his way
through the mob. As if by magic half a score
of policemen suddenly hemmed in the fighting
mass. Druce, struggling blindly to make a
pathway for himself, suddenly looked up to
see Mary Randall standing on a table on the
opposite side of the room directing the police.
A wave of maniacal anger overwhelmed him.
In a flash his hand went to his pocket and
reappeared with a pistol.
</p>
<p>There was an explosion, a man&#8217;s yell of
rage, followed by a choking gulp of mortal
anguish. Druce was seized and flung to the
floor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>At the same moment Mary Randall, leaping
down from her table, ran to the center of
the room. Carter Anson lay there, struggling
through his last throes,&mdash;the bullet in his
brain.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>AFTER THE TRAGEDY</h3>
</div>

<p>Mary Randall stood beside the
dead body of Carter Anson. Such
tragedy had not entered into her plans, nor
had she conceived what it might be to see a
man die bearing the bullet intended for her
own intrepid heart. A strange numbness possessed
her faculties.
</p>
<p>She heard the voice of Mrs. Welcome
beside her. The mother was speaking with
anguished entreaty to Elsie. The girl had
risen to her feet and was gazing with a dreadful
fascination at Druce, writhing in the
grasp of the officers who seized him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Miss Randall,&#8221; one of her police
aids said to the reformer. &#8220;This is no place
for you&mdash;now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be something I can do,&#8221; she
spoke with a flash of her usual energy, then
laid her hand on Mrs. Welcome&#8217;s arm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Harvey Spencer is here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There
he is trying to get through the crowd to us
now. Perhaps he can help you to persuade
your daughter to go away with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie Welcome looked at Mary Randall,
who was destined never to forget the pitiful
revelation of the girl&#8217;s dark eyes. Mary
Randall read that despair of the lost mingled
with woman&#8217;s intense clinging to the man she
has chosen,&mdash;her strange stubborn clinging,
when, entangled, she hears an echo of happier
and purer love.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you meddle in people&#8217;s affairs
like this and put us into such dreadful
trouble?&#8221; Elsie asked of the one who would
help her. Then to her mother, pulling away
from her longing clasp, &#8220;You understand
that at a time like this my place is with my
husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie doubled under the arms which would
have detained her and ran out of the cafe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to Millville, Mrs. Welcome, back to
your old home, as soon you can. Let me look
after Elsie. Go to this boarding-house (handing
her a card). Go there with Patience tonight,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
and I will send you some money
tomorrow.&#8221; Miss Randall spoke quickly, and
before Mrs. Welcome realized it, had hurried
in pursuit of Elsie.
</p>
<p>But Elsie Welcome had disappeared.
</p>
<p>Mary Randall found herself standing, as
all who work for those who sin and suffer
must often stand, baffled by evil&#8217;s resistance.
Saddened by somewhat of a divine sadness,
Mary went across to the rendezvous where her
faithful Anna awaited her and left the field.
</p>
<p>Harvey Spencer came to her downtown
office early next day. He found her surrounded
by her strongest allies, already in conference
as to the best means of pursuing their
crusade which had aroused Chicago with the
startling news of The Raid of Mary Randall
on the Cafe Sinister, headlined in the morning
newspapers.
</p>
<p>Harvey Spencer had taken Mrs. Welcome
to the boarding-house designated by Miss
Randall where she was joined by Patience&mdash;and
of Patience you shall know presently. The
remainder of the night, or most of it, he spent
trying to learn what had become of Elsie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she might be still in that&mdash;hotel,
as they call it,&#8221; Harvey, haggard with his
night&#8217;s search, told Miss Randall. &#8220;I went
to the jail too, but of course they would not
let her inside there so late, even if she had
wanted to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is sure to go there today to see Druce.
Try again, Mr. Spencer, when you go out
from here,&#8221; said Miss Randall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And keep you eye on Druce. Nobody will
suspect you of being a detective. You can
telephone here if you see any activity around
him,&#8221; said a clever special from headquarters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good scheme,&#8221; commended the journalist,
another of Mary Randall&#8217;s strongest aids.
</p>
<p>Harvey Spencer made notes of the right
steps to take and, thanking Miss Randall with
a curious humility, went out again on his quest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must learn what the vice-moneymakers
will try to do next,&#8221; said a former
high official in the municipality. &#8220;Our one
safe bet is that they will all get together and
that John Boland, the boss of the bunch, will
map out the fight against us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a losing fight?&#8221; asked a famous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
banker, known among his intimates as the
hard-headed enthusiast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right against wrong can never be permanently
a losing fight,&#8221; quietly said a small muscular
clergyman from the northwest side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has taken two thousand years for mankind
to begin this fight against buying and
selling young virgins who can be coaxed or
thrust into the market-place,&#8221; said Mary Randall.
&#8220;We must fight on, even in one seemingly
losing field. It is not to be believed that
the people of this nation will be content to
submit very much longer to the presence of a
band of prowling wolves tolerated by courts
and protected by rascally lawyers whose
acknowledged trade is to destroy virtue,&mdash;the
latent motherhood of young women,&mdash;whose
whole activity is directed to the exploitation of
our little lost sisters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chicago has to lead the fight, as she has
been one of the leaders in the trade,&#8221; said the
banker. &#8220;Now, for our next step!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE HIGHWAY OF THE UPRIGHT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Up to the moment when he heard the
report of Druce&#8217;s pistol and saw Carter
Anson fall, Harry Boland&#8217;s whole being had
been concentrated in a consuming horror at
sight of Patience Welcome in the Cafe
Sinister.
</p>
<p>The crack of the pistol restored his composure.
He saw clearly the infamy of the
plot against her,&mdash;and against himself. One
of the conspirators was already dead on the
scene of this last of many crimes. Druce was
struggling with the police, taking him for
murder of Anson, his partner.
</p>
<p>John Boland, the third conspirator, faced
his son in a desperate composure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Harry, we must get out of here.
It will never do to be seen here&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For you!&#8221; Harry shook off his father&#8217;s
hand upon his arm. &#8220;Go, by all means! I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
shall take care of myself.&#8221; He walked towards
the singers&#8217; platform beyond the seething
crowd.
</p>
<p>John Boland believed of himself afterwards
that he would have followed Harry, but at
the moment he saw a bowed and gray-haired
woman before him, great fear and horror on
her face, pressing her way in from scrubbing
in the booths beyond. The mop and bucket
with which she had been working were in
either hand. At sight of his face she dropped
her tools of toil and clutched his coat. It was
Tom Welcome&#8217;s widow.
</p>
<p>He uttered a cry like a beast of prey as
he shook her off; but he felt himself shiver,
conscience making him a coward, and he hurried
out, reaching by an exit the alley leading
to a side street.
</p>
<p>A police lieutenant suddenly barred his way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast there,&#8221; said the functionary.
</p>
<p>Boland recognized the man as an officer
whom he had once placed under obligation
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Murphy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Boland!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I was passing and heard the shot.
You understand, of course, that I wish to
avoid being seen here. Do you know where I
can find a taxi?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The policeman turned and summoned a
taxicab with a gesture. Boland got in at the
open door. He leaned forward and spoke
with peculiar force, although very low:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If my son, Harry Boland, happens to pass
by here, see that he gets into a taxi whose
driver will bring him to my house, to my house,
remember, no matter what address he gives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, sir.&#8221; Probably the young
man&#8217;s been misbehaving, was what he thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay the driver&mdash;in advance&mdash;with this, or
part of it,&#8221; continued Mr. Boland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; thank you. I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland&#8217;s car scuttled away into the
darkness.
</p>
<p>Harry Boland, pushing through the crowd
to Patience, saw the futile effort of Mrs.
Welcome to take Elsie from the place. He
heard Mary Randall&#8217;s brief direction and
spoke reassuringly to the anguished mother as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
he pressed a friendly hand on her slight
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see that Spencer takes you to that
boarding-house, where you will be comfortable
until you can get away. I will bring
Patience. We may get there before you
arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As John Boland foresaw, it was but a few
moments after his own departure before
Harry Boland reached the street looking for a
conveyance. He was assisting Patience Welcome.
Rather, she was clinging to him,
sobbing like a frightened child. The shooting
that had interrupted her pathetic attempt to
sing was only part of the tragedy to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I saw my little sister in there,&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;She called me by name. And such
a pathetic cry. Did you hear it?&#8221; Patience
was sadly unnerved and ill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, dear one,&#8221; Harry soothed her.
&#8220;Your mother, Harvey and Miss Randall
are there, you know. Whatever can be done,
they will do. You are my one and only care,
and just now, dearest girl, you&#8217;re ill. I&#8217;ll take
you to the place where your mother is going.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Now, please stop crying; try&mdash;try&mdash;everything
will be all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A taxicab appeared, the chauffeur seemingly
having anticipated that he was wanted.
Harry got in, half carrying Patience, and
expecting to be stopped by an officer. But no
policeman seemed to see or hear him as he gave
the driver the address of the old-fashioned
boarding-house selected by Mary Randall.
</p>
<p>They rode in silence. Patience sat apart
from him, breathing deeply of the fresh air
at the window of the car as they rushed swiftly
through the city streets. Slowly he felt the
tension of the situation released. It was as if
the dazed girl were freed from the physical
mesh which had been thrown about her.
</p>
<p>Then she spoke quite calmly, in her natural
voice, but very slowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, I once dreamed that I was in terrible
trouble and that you came and helped
me. Are you sure I am not dreaming now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a happy dream, if you are, my
darling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; faltered Patience. &#8220;It
is wonderful to be here with&mdash;you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you trust me, Patience? Do you trust
me when I tell you that I care more for you
than I ever knew I could care for anybody?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make you happy. I want to love
you and work for you and have you for my
wife, and make a home with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; She slipped her hand into his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, I still feel afraid. It was such a
dreadful thing to see. Was that man killed?
It was he who asked me to sing. They had
been disappointed about getting a singer, he
said, and he gave me ten dollars. All that
money for a few songs&mdash;it seemed like stealing.
But I took it. Mother helped put on
this dress they gave me to sing in. You know
I went there to help mother clean the place.
And to think we saw a murder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor darling!&#8221; Something in his
voice caused her to put her hand up to his face.
He felt her finger tips on his eyelids, then
down his wet cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor darling!&#8221; She put her arm
around his neck&mdash;then their trembling lips
met.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>Harry was the first to speak. &#8220;All that you
have gone through brings us closer together
than anything else in life possibly could,
Patience. I am so proud of you and so down
on myself that I ever let you out of my
sight&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be down on my&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it, dear! I want to hear my sweetheart
say the word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say &#8216;my dearest,&#8217; but I&#8217;ll
say,&mdash;if you want me to,&mdash;my&mdash;my husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear, sweet wife!&#8221; responded Harry.
</p>
<p>After a few moments Harry observed that
they were being taken farther than he had
directed the man to go. The boarding-house
was rather close to town. He found that they
were well on the north side, nearing the quarter
of his father&#8217;s house. He called to stop
the driver, but the man remained deaf to his
efforts, except to increase the speed, and
presently drew up at the Boland mansion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you bring me here?&#8221; Harry
demanded, stepping out of the car to remonstrate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Orders! I ordered you where I wanted
you to go. Here, if you need two fares for
one job, you swindler! Hold on&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Driver! Come here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry heard his father&#8217;s stern voice from
the opened doorway. &#8220;Driver! Take that
girl wherever she wants to go. Harry, come
in here! It&#8217;s time for a show-down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is time for a show-down!&#8221;
Harry assisted Patience from the car. &#8220;You
may wait and earn the fare I just paid you or
go to jail,&#8221; he said to the driver, and boldly
led Patience into his father&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>The elder Boland turned into a den at the
right of the front hallway and closed the door.
He looked at Patience with an appraising
glance, then kindly at his son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you must be humored in this
affair,&#8221; he said in an indulgent manner,
&#8220;while you haven&#8217;t sense to see that the present
is scarcely the time to devote yourself to
any such young woman. What do you say to
a trip to California? I&#8217;ll foot all the bills, and
later I will settle what you ask for on you.&#8221;
He spoke to Patience.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; She spoke without a tremor.
&#8220;You may do something substantial for my
mother, because you&mdash;took&mdash;my poor father&#8217;s
invention. Do you know, sir, that my poor
father never recovered from that loss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s fire!&#8221; yelled John Boland, &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; interrupted Harry deliberately,
&#8220;it really is time for a show-down. I
wouldn&#8217;t go away from Chicago at present,
even for the wedding journey which we will
pretend you were honestly offering us. I am
going to stay and fight it out. You will have
to stay and fight it out, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; blustered Boland. &#8220;What have I
got to fight out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well why you were at
Druce&#8217;s cafe tonight. You were in a plot
against me, leagued with that fellow, Druce,
and his tribe, too, against the crusade started
by Mary Randall to protect girls. You prefer
to make money exploiting them. Not directly,
perhaps, but conspicuously indirect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are turning traitor in&mdash;politics?&#8221;
sneered his father. &#8220;Taking sides with a crazy
fanatic, whose presence at the cafe caused the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
death of a good citizen of Chicago. Druce
did not mean to shoot Anson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see your line of defense. It&#8217;s you who
have turned traitor&mdash;to all that is right in you
as a man. See, here is the anonymous letter
which summoned me to the cafe tonight. I
wish you could tell me that you do not know
who wrote that note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland read the letter scornfully. &#8220;How
should I know who writes you letters? Young
men who make alliances with women who frequent
such places must expect such messages,&#8221;
he sneered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; Harry&#8217;s eyes blazed with anger.
&#8220;We have borne all that we shall of that sort
from you. One more such syllable and I shall
not be able to speak to you as to my father&mdash;even
in outward respect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem already to have forgotten that
completely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry let the sneer pass. &#8220;It is up to you,
sir, to decide now&mdash;this moment&mdash;whether or
not I ever look upon you as my father again.
I have myself decided that I shall no longer
be a party to your crimes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Crimes! My God, this is too much!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too shrewd a man to have a fool
for a son. I see plainly that you were leagued
with Druce and Anson to blacken the woman
I love. But right is might and love is right.
The whole dastardly affair enlightens me as
to the nature of your alliance with that dive.
Why did you renew the lease to Druce against
my protest? I never realized until tonight the
horror of your extensive holdings of tenderloin
property. I don&#8217;t want another cent from
such sources.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; The elder Boland shook with
anger. &#8220;Get out of this house, you and
your&mdash;fitting mate. Never let me see your
face again. Tomorrow I will undertake a
campaign which will brand you among your
friends as a son who turned traitor to his father
in his hour of stress. All my power, all my
money, will be against you. I will crush you
as I have every man who has dared oppose me.
Get out of my house!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry gazed at his father in a tumult of
pity and wrath, but he did not speak.
</p>
<p>Patience, her eyes filled with tears, her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
hands nervously clutching her &#8217;kerchief,
walked up to the angry man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;just as I
always used to be sorry for my poor father
when he was drunk as you are now with your
own anger. You know that I <i>am</i> a fitting
mate for your son. I don&#8217;t understand your
enmity unless it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re not rich like
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry caught Patience in his arms. &#8220;Remember,
it makes no difference to me what my
father says. I&#8217;m a man and able to choose my
own wife.&#8221; He looked at his father. &#8220;We
are going now,&#8221; he said firmly.
</p>
<p>There was no reply.
</p>
<p>The door closed behind his son. John
Boland staggered to a couch and falling down
beside it buried his face in his arms.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE INTERESTS VERSUS MARY RANDALL</h3>
</div>

<p>If John Boland was shaken by the
interview with his son, there was no evidence
of it in his bearing when he appeared at
the offices of the Electric Trust the following
morning. As he took his accustomed place at
his desk he looked tired, but he wore what La
Salle street knew as his fighting face.
</p>
<p>Boland had scarcely established himself for
the day when he discovered that his decision
to remain in Chicago had been anticipated by
those who knew him well in affairs. A dozen
messages were waiting for him. The forces
opposed to Mary Randall and her reforms
looked to him for leadership.
</p>
<p>As soon as the details of the raid on the
Cafe Sinister had become definitely known,
there had been a quick general movement on
the part of the leaders of the Levee to get
together. They met in secret places to deplore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the taking off of Anson, to form alliances
against their common enemy. From these
meetings went appeals for protection to the
forces higher up.
</p>
<p>Aid was invoked of the great financial interests
involved, directly and indirectly, in the
traffic in souls. Political overlords of the city
sent word that the protection demanded should
not be wanting. Within twelve hours they
had effected an organization whose ramifications
extended into wholly unexpected places.
Then, having formed the machine, they turned
with one accord to John Boland to guide it.
</p>
<p>His acceptance of this leadership was unavoidable,
even if he had wished to avoid it.
To reject it would have been treason to the
forces which had fought side by side with him
in many a former and desperate campaign.
To give Boland credit, his courage was equal
to the task he had no wish to avoid. He knew
the situation was dangerous, but he was a
fighter born.
</p>
<p>Having made up his mind to give battle,
Boland addressed himself to the task of outlining
his campaign. He was too shrewd, too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
thoroughly familiar with all the elements
making up Chicago, to underestimate his
enemy. He knew that Mary Randall was
appealing passionately to a public morality
which hated the vice system with a wholehearted
hatred. He knew, too, that when the
light of truth fell upon his followers they
would scurry to shelter. His first step was to
exclude from his offices every employe of
whose loyalty he could not be completely certain.
He had his bitter lesson on that score,
certainly, he told himself.
</p>
<p>By telephone and by private messenger he
proceeded to summon his chief allies to a conference.
These men arrived within an hour.
One was a United States Senator, two were
bankers of impeccable reputation. One was a
political boss whose authority was a by-word
in one of the great parties, another a philanthropist
whose spectacular gratuities to public
institutions came from huge dividends made
for him by underpaid employes, and with him
a clergyman managed by this philanthropist
and the bankers and a newspaper publisher
whose little soul had been often bought and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
sold, so that certain of his profession were
wont to say one could see thumb-marks of
Mammon on him as he passed by.
</p>
<p>Boland did not invite Grogan to this meeting.
He intended at first to ask him, but his
friend had shown too much sympathy of late
with sentiment in life.
</p>
<p>John Boland&#8217;s council of war was in session
for five hours. Every phase of the situation
was taken up and discussed with thoroughness
characteristic of these leaders of men, with
thoroughness, too, that showed full familiarity
with all the conditions of commercialized vice
in Chicago. The evasions and bombast wherewith
these citizens were accustomed to adorn
their public addresses before vice commission
inquiries were strangely lacking. They spoke
among themselves plainly and without pretenses.
</p>
<p>Towards the close of this conference John
Boland offered his plan of action:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he addressed the others from
the head of his directors&#8217; table in his inner
office. &#8220;We all agree that what we have most
to fear is publicity. In fact, if these reformers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
had no publicity they would be without
weapons. As you are aware, the extent to
which we can control the newspapers is limited.
If news comes to them in the regular
way they are bound to print it, so if we are
to avoid disastrous publicity we must stop it
at its source.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At this moment the &#8216;news&#8217; of the situation
centers about Druce and those of his employes
who are now in jail. We can&#8217;t prevent his
being indicted, we can&#8217;t prevent his case coming
to trial, if we allow him to remain in jail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends, I need not tell you that such a
trial would fill the newspapers with what they
call &#8216;exposures&#8217; of vice conditions that would
be calamitous. You all agree with me that
vice is a terrible thing. We know&mdash;none better,
as our discussions have indicated&mdash;how
great this evil is in our city. But there is
something more menacing than vice,&mdash;namely,
an ill-controlled and hysterical anti-vice crusade,
rushing on and intoxicating itself with
its own sensations, and shaking the business
fabric of the city.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the want that will come to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
poor in Chicago if confidence in our leading
business men should be seriously shaken! It
is our duty as pillars&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;of
Chicago&#8217;s financial structure to avoid, to prevent,
public trials of vice cases.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we to go about suppressing the
excitement of a trial of Martin Druce?
Various expedients suggest themselves to us
all. Is not the most feasible to have Druce
released on bail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to any amount!&#8221; called two voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the matter can be arranged,&#8221;
replied John Boland, graciously. &#8220;Indeed, I
have taken the liberty to discuss that phase of
the situation with Judge Grundell. He is of
opinion that Druce can be freed. My own
attorneys have given the subject some consideration
also. As I understand it, Druce is
booked for murder&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is murder a bailable offense in Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ordinarily, no. But in this case it can be
shown that there were extenuating circumstances.
We can make a showing of facts to
demonstrate that the killing of Carter Anson
was purely accidental.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Druce was only trying to shoot Mary Randall,
as I heard it,&#8221; said a grim voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Suppose we say instead that Druce
thought some one was creating a disturbance
in his place of business, became excited and
fired. The bullet hit Anson. Our opponents
are not expecting, probably, any move by us
towards the release of Druce on bail. It is
unlikely that they will resist the application.
In any event, I have already taken up the
matter with the judge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With Druce freed and resting in safe
seclusion, I consider it advisable to place him
in possession of facilities that will enable him
to remain at liberty for an indefinite period&mdash;until
this excitement has blown over, you
understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can send him out to China on business,&#8221;
said one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. My attorney has a young man
who will see that he is rightly started on his
journey, avoiding all publicity. The cases of
his employes will come on for trial; but with
Druce out of the way, it will be extremely
difficult for our opponents to obtain any convictions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Thus this whole sensation will fall
flat and the reform crusaders will find themselves
discredited before the public.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Applause welcomed John Boland&#8217;s summing
up of the situation and his formulation
of a practical plan. Members of the conference
rose smiling cheerfully, shook hands all
around and made it plain that each was ready
to pay, pay, pay. The door had not closed
behind them before John Boland set in motion
the machinery which was to set Martin Druce
free.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>OUT ON BAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>When Martin Druce heard the news
that bail had been raised for his release
and that all arrangements were being made
for his flight and concealment, it was exactly
half an hour before the bail bond was signed
and the order sent to the prison that he should
be set at liberty.
</p>
<p>Broken by his incarceration, terrified by his
murderous experience of the last night at the
cafe, red-eyed and restless, the dive-keeper
was pacing up and down his cell. A pickpocket
whom he knew and who, through his
own political pull was serving a term as a
trusty, brought the information to him
scrawled on a bit of cigarette paper which,
with a little warning whistle, he dropped
through the bars of the steel cage.
</p>
<p>Druce picked up the note and read it furtively.
He waited for the trusty to pass him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
again, then beckoning him, he whispered,
&#8220;See if my gal isn&#8217;t outside somewhere.
She just left here. Tell her to wait. She can
get into the automobile which they will be
sure to send for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not affection, but cowardice, that led
Druce to think of Elsie first. Since he had
been locked up he had crumbled under his
trouble. He was so much shaken in mind and
body by the killing of Anson and by his arrest
that he was actually afraid to go out of the
jail alone.
</p>
<p>After what seemed an eternity of waiting
he heard footsteps in the corridor. A guard
appeared and unlocked the iron door, beckoned
to Druce, and he passed out.
</p>
<p>In a little waiting-room an iron-faced jail
attendant handed him his watch and knife and
some money taken from him when he was
locked up. A lawyer whom he knew signaled
him to follow.
</p>
<p>Another steel door stood open and Druce
found himself outside the prison, breathing the
free air of night. An automobile stood there.
Druce saw that Elsie was already within.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The driver has instructions,&#8221; said the
lawyer. &#8220;Later you will hear further from
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What to hell are they going to do for me?&#8221;
growled Druce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No time to argue,&#8221; said the lawyer.
&#8220;Here!&#8221; He pressed something in his hand.
&#8220;Your game is to get away while the getting
is good.&#8221; He slammed the door as Druce got
in. The car turned the corner and went north.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; Elsie asked.
</p>
<p>Druce mumbled an unintelligible answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up your ranting at me!&#8221; He shook
off her hand. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll get your three
squares a day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was said for several moments.
Elsie lay back with her eyes closed. By the
light from occasional street lamps Druce was
counting a roll of bills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, kid, look at this.&#8221; He spoke with
just a touch of softness and bravado. &#8220;That
young guy slipped it to me. My backers got
to give me a nice trip to foreign lands. There&#8217;ll
be plenty of kale. I&#8217;m going to take you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
along, see.&#8221; He did not add that her too great
knowledge of his methods made others desirous
that she, too, should be far away when the
trial of the dive&#8217;s employes came to pass.
Elsie opened her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would show that you
feel a little bit glad that I&#8217;m out,&#8221; he whined.
&#8220;Think of those days in that jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie would not have dared fail to express
sympathy for him, but he was in need of a
match for the cigarette he held. Hailing the
chauffeur, he had the next instant forgotten
his demand.
</p>
<p>They drove in silence until they reached the
house that had been prepared for their hiding-place.
&#8220;Furnished rooms&mdash;Light Housekeeping&#8221;
was inscribed on a card, tacked conspicuously
in the doorway.
</p>
<p>A woman near middle age, inclined to be
fleshy, with large features that reflected the
dim hall light, met them, her arms akimbo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s all right for you folks. Upstairs
front. There&#8217;s a gas stove in the closet
if you all&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t pikers&mdash;we&#8217;ll get our eats sent in.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Here, take this.&#8221; Druce put a slip of paper
and a greenback into Elsie&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the drug-store there at the corner
and get this prescription filled,&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s morphine. I&#8217;ve got to sleep tonight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie obeyed passively. When she returned
Druce was pacing the room wild with impatience.
His greenbacks and a bottle of
absinthe lay on the table.
</p>
<p>He lost no time in resorting to the morphine.
&#8220;Absinthe is the stuff to put life in
your body; but it&#8217;s the good old dope to make
you forget all your troubles,&#8221; he soliloquized,
Very shortly he was on the bed, sound asleep.
</p>
<p>Elsie paced softly back and forth in the
room for a long time. Then she went out into
the dark hallway. She opened the window
and stood looking into the street. It was quiet
there. The stars looked down on a deserted
way.
</p>
<p>That big bright star over there! Was it not
the one she and her sister used to choose when
wishing from their bedroom window at Millville!
How long ago that seemed; how wide
and dreadful life&#8217;s abyss between!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I had known, if I had known!&#8221; Elsie
shuddered and glanced towards the closed
door. &#8220;I was bound to have my own way.
My&mdash;own&mdash;way. That&#8217;s it. There was something
in me&mdash;&#8221; She faced her actions, she
probed into her thoughts from the hour she
first met Martin Druce. She marshalled her
scathing shames before the judgment bar of
her womanhood. In the flaming fires of tortured
conscience she stood and suffered.
</p>
<p>Then she began to wonder about the future.
Where was she bound? Where would he be
sent? What strange lands might she see?
</p>
<p>How could she go with him? How could
she stay behind? The street&mdash;the dreadful
streets of night!
</p>
<p>Elsie shuddered, remembering those nights
in the Levee, the fear and horror, and at last
the shameful, gnawing hunger that drove her
to him again.
</p>
<p>Back in the room where the dive-keeper lay
in stupor Elsie spread a quilt on the floor and
went wearily to her broken rest.
</p>
<p>When she awoke Druce was trying nervously
to roll a cigarette. The paper broke.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you, it&#8217;s morning. It&#8217;s time you
woke up. Take this money. Get me some
cigarettes. I can&#8217;t roll them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a being frightening to see by this
time. The morphine and the French poison
had torn his nerves to fragments. His eyes
glared like coals in his pasty white face.
</p>
<p>Elsie did not try to talk to him. She saw
that he was beyond that. She took some
money from the table and went out again to
buy the cigarettes and food. When she returned
Druce refused to eat. He took up the
bottle of absinthe and drank from it, swallowing
the burning liquid with animal-like gulps
that made Elsie shudder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kill yourself,&#8221; said Elsie. &#8220;Take
some of this milk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your own damn business,&#8221; returned
Druce, hoarsely. &#8220;You stick to milk. I&#8217;ll
stick to absinthe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he lay down and again he slept. The
long day passed. Night came and with a wild
wind and a beating rain.
</p>
<p>Druce woke in a half delirium.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More absinthe, more absinthe,&#8221; he muttered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
The bottle on the table was empty.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you have another bottle here?
What have you been doing, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you better take any more?&#8221;
asked Elsie.
</p>
<p>Druce stood glaring at her. His eyes
flamed as he rushed across the room like a
madman. Before she could get out of his way
he struck her a brutal blow that felled her to
the floor, and kicked her as she struggled. He
reached for the empty bottle and brandished
it over her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you, get out of here quick and get
me that dope!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie got to her feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; she said, faintly.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>HARVEY SPENCER TAKES UP THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Harvey had waited about the jail for
days. He was certain that Elsie Welcome
would return to Druce, and he was
resolved to make a great effort to induce her
to leave him.
</p>
<p>In his unsubtle makeup the measure of his
devotion was as great as the measure of his
unspoiled manhood. The girl he wished to
make his wife had been taken from him. She
had removed herself far from his kindness and
care, but he could not cease to offer her the
care she needed more poignantly than before.
</p>
<p>The personal interest of so conspicuous a
person as Mary Randall, in Elsie&#8217;s case, had
undoubtedly urged Harvey on&mdash;when otherwise
he might have given up. Even so, his
courage and persistency, and personal sacrifices,
were wonderful to behold.
</p>
<p>On the night when Druce was at last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
removed from the jail Harvey was standing
in an alley opposite the public entrance to the
jail watching the automobile which stood
awaiting the coming of someone from within.
</p>
<p>Finally he saw the slender figure of a
woman emerge from a doorway and enter
the automobile. He knew that figure. He
ran across the street and around the car. He
noted its number with one of those keen
flashes of memory, conscious at the moment
that he should remember that number as long
as he drew breath.
</p>
<p>He flung open the door on the further side
of the automobile.
</p>
<p>Elsie faced him. &#8220;What are you doing
here?&#8221; she asked in an icy little voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;no&mdash;Won&#8217;t you come to your mother,
Elsie? Won&#8217;t you come away from this man?
Your mother and Patience love you so much
and have been trying so hard to find you
and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, Harvey&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Oh! Go
away. Druce is coming. He will&mdash;hurt you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter about me. It&#8217;s you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I must stand by my husband.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Husband! He isn&#8217;t your husband. He
fooled you with a marriage license. Anybody
can get a license in Chicago, but Druce&#8217;s
license was never returned. He likely got
some fellow to pretend to perform the marriage.
Elsie, it wasn&#8217;t legal, I can prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For an instant Elsie&#8217;s spirit flamed in her
eyes and her burning cheeks paled. Then she
saw Druce coming and she turned towards
him wearily, a strange quivering and drooping
of her eyelids alone showing that she had
heard. In the presence of her master she grew
meek as a little child.
</p>
<p>Harvey drifted back into the shadows of the
jail, powerless to help her, and saw her driven
away with the man who had ruined her earthly
life.
</p>
<p>Fighting his grief and despair, he went to
the nearest drug-store and telephoned Miss
Randall of what he had seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Druce out on bail! A murderer out on
bail in Chicago!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, Harvey,
if only you had thought to jump into a taxicab
and follow them to see where they have
been taken.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no detective. I am going back to Millville.
Perhaps I can get back my old job in
the grocery store,&#8221; he answered grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Miss Randall! Hello! I remember
the number of the machine.&#8221; He gave it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Wait a minute till I see whose that
is. Hold the wire.&#8221; She consulted her list of
the automobile numbers entered in Illinois and
found that this one belonged to a professional
bondsman named Comstock.
</p>
<p>She gave Harvey the man&#8217;s residence
number.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go out there first thing in the morning and
see if you can find out from the chauffeur
where the machine went tonight. Keep a stiff
upper lip, Mr. Spencer, you have really done
splendidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey went early next day to the address
given him, a residence of the type called stone-fronted,
in a district no longer fashionable.
There was a garage, but no automobile.
Harvey made a careful survey of the premises
without gaining ground. He saw another of
Mary Randall&#8217;s aids come, linger about and go
away; but remembering her advice about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
keeping a stiff upper lip, he stayed on. He
was to be rewarded late in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>A car rumbled into the garage. Its colored
driver immediately began washing it and
Harvey sauntered back into the yard. The
number on it was the one printed on his
memory.
</p>
<p>From somewhere back in his tired brain
came the impulse to say,
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a repair man from Gavin&#8217;s garage.
Mr. Comstock told me to come over and take
a look at his car. Said he had it out in the
rain last night and it wasn&#8217;t working right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sah; that car certainly has been drove
last night. Some of the battery connections
got wet.&#8221; The chauffeur was glib enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lights and ignition out of order?&#8221; Harvey
pretended to examine the car, asking seemingly
careless questions and gaining from the
negro the information that the car had gone
from the jail with Druce to an obscure street
far out on the northwest side. The man could
not give the number of the house, but said it
was one of three in the middle of &#8220;a short
little street.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>Harvey made the excuse that he must go
back to the garage where he was employed to
get his tools, and hurried away.
</p>
<p>It was growing dark and a wild, stormy rain-wind
was blowing when he reached the remote
neighborhood described for him by the bondsman&#8217;s
talkative servant. He was gazing at
the three forbidding dwellings standing near
the center of the block, trying to make up his
mind which to approach first, when he saw
Elsie in her long rain-coat come out of the
middle house, hesitate a moment, then hurry
down the steps into the street.
</p>
<p>He slipped into the shadow of a house, his
heart thumping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsie!&#8221; he called softly in a voice scarcely
above a whisper.
</p>
<p>She stopped, startled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it Harvey?&#8221; Elsie peered doubtingly
into the darkness, then stepped trustingly
towards him as he replied,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s sure Harvey.&#8221; He caught the
sadness in her words and his voice shook.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come away with me now? Your
mother wants you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your life is in danger with him. Why
don&#8217;t you leave him?&#8221; he added earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Oh, if I only
could! My mother and Patience&mdash;how are
they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are well and safe, only they want
you. They&#8217;re going back to Millville, to the
same cottage. It&#8217;s going to be all fixed over.
Patience is going to be married&mdash;Mr. Harry
Boland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears streamed from Elsie&#8217;s eyes. She
leaned against the iron fence that skirted the
sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, Harvey, I just couldn&#8217;t go
home? I couldn&#8217;t bear to make Patience&mdash;ashamed
of me. Don&#8217;t tell her that, though,
will you? Tell them that I have to stay with
my&mdash;my&mdash;oh, don&#8217;t let mother know you saw
me. Don&#8217;t let her know any different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor little thing&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked about her in alarm. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t
stay here. You mustn&#8217;t, either. It&#8217;s no use,
Harvey. The life&#8217;s got me&mdash;I can&#8217;t turn back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment she was running down
the street as if hurrying from a pursuer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>Harvey saw her enter the corner drug-store,
waited a little while, then decided he too had
business in the drug-store. He would telephone
Miss Randall&mdash;but he must be careful.
Elsie was receiving a package from the drug
clerk, as he entered the &#8217;phone booth&mdash;and left
while he was talking. Harvey was standing
with his face to the wall, speaking in a whisper,
lest his message would be overheard. He did
not see Elsie depart.
</p>
<p>He got the reformer herself on the telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found them,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Joy and relief were in her tones.
&#8220;Watch them carefully, won&#8217;t you? We&#8217;ll
have detectives there in a jiffy with a new
warrant for Druce. This time for white
slavery. He will not escape us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey gave the number of the house where
Druce and Elsie had been hidden, appointed a
rendezvous with the detective and returned
at once to watch the house. He decided that
Elsie had hurried back while he was at the telephone.
</p>
<p>In less than an hour an automobile rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
up to the house. Two men got out and hurried
into the place. One of them he recognized
as the lawyer he had seen at the entrance
of the jail. There were not his detectives.
</p>
<p>The storm had increased and the rain was
driving in blinding torrents across the street.
</p>
<p>Harvey saw a group of people suddenly
emerge from the house. The chauffeur
jumped down and took part with the struggling
little crowd. He could hear Druce
swearing loudly, calling out Elsie&#8217;s name with
words of abuse. The men pushed the drunken
man into the car, and got in after him.
</p>
<p>Harvey looked about for some sort of a
vehicle, but none was in sight and the auto
was actually starting. He sprang on the rear,
spring and, crouching, hung on desperately.
They drove for a long time; to him it seemed
hours as his hands grew numb and his muscles
ached from clinging to his precarious hold.
Fortunately the storm had subsided.
</p>
<p>The driver turned into a dark, cobble paved
street. The auto swayed and jolted like a
ship on the rocks. The road was full of pitch-holes
and as the wheels slipped into them a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
blinding spray of muddy water was flung into
Harvey&#8217;s face. The machine put on more
speed and swung around a corner. Another
hole! The car careened, almost turned over,
and Harvey was thrown into the street.
</p>
<p>As he struggled to his feet the red rear light
of the automobile was two blocks away. But
he went on, gasping for breath, stumbling.
Presently he found himself in the district near
the river, close to the north side water front,
which is deserted after night-fall.
</p>
<p>He had hurried on like a man in a dream.
Now he came to the edge of the river and
stood staring down into the water.
</p>
<p>Out in the stream he could see the shadowy
outline of a boat. Looking more closely, he
saw that he was scarcely two hundred feet
from the craft. The darkness had multiplied
the distance; it was now penetrated by a lantern
light moving on the deck, evidently in the
hand of someone who was standing aft on the
boat.
</p>
<p>There was distinct, loud talking and swearing
between men.
</p>
<p>Harvey thought that it was a fishing smack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Its demonstrative passengers were bent upon
waking up the night and almost woke him up
to the purpose of his night&#8217;s errand when he
heard a loud voice say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut that out, Druce. No more boozing,
d&#8217;you hear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;D-r-u-c-e.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey was as near fainting as a healthy
young man might be with the shock of this
surprise after his tremendous exertions and
his fall. He stood as if petrified.
</p>
<p>But his ears still caught the sound of swearing
and he saw men moving quickly about on
the deck, then the gray white of sails spreading
like gaunt ghosts. The swish of water told
him that the boat was moving, that his quarry
was slipping into pitch-blackness ahead.
</p>
<p>That was the finish of his courage.
</p>
<p>Harvey felt his limbs trembling, felt something
trickle down his face. He was beaten.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FORCES THAT CONQUER</h3>
</div>

<p>When the tenderloin learned that Martin
Druce had been released on a bond
for thirty thousand dollars, the tenderloin
laughed.
</p>
<p>The laugh was low and cunning and there
was more than the suggestion of a sneer in it.
It rang from one end of the district to the
other, convulsing dive-keepers who for days
had been as funereal as undertakers. It
sounded in dance halls and bagnios, in barrooms
and gambling dens.
</p>
<p>It eddied up into Chicago&#8217;s higher air and
found an echo in clubs frequented by distinguished
financier-politicians.
</p>
<p>John Boland had won! The brain that had
never failed had proved its resourcefulness
once again in this hour of dire trouble. Druce
was gone. He would never be heard of in
Chicago again. It had cost thirty thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
dollars, but what was thirty thousand dollars?
Mary Randall and her crusaders were
crushed. Anson was dead. Druce was gone.
</p>
<p>What mattered it now how much evidence
Mary Randall had gathered in against the
Cafe Sinister! There would be a period of
quiet. The tenderloin would carefully observe
all the proprieties. Then the case of the State
against Martin Druce would be called and
Druce would not respond to that summons.
And so Mary Randall&#8217;s sensation would die
an unnatural death&mdash;death from smothering,
death from lack of expression. Afterward the
tenderloin would resume its old operations.
No wonder the tenderloin laughed!
</p>
<p>John Boland felt none of this exultation
when he returned to his office on the morning
following Druce&#8217;s release. An indefinable
oppression weighed him down. He had won,
he knew&mdash;and yet the air about him seemed
charged with prescience of evil. He tried to
shake it off and could not. He was anxious,
too, about Harry. Why, he asked himself,
should he worry about an ungrateful son.
John Boland did not know the answer, yet the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
answer was very plain. His son Harry was
his own flesh and blood and no man can cut
himself off from his own flesh and blood without
feeling some sort of reaction.
</p>
<p>John Boland, the man of brain and iron
was only human after all. He loved his son.
</p>
<p>He was in a state of gloomy meditation
when he opened his desk and resumed his day&#8217;s
work. The telephone bell jangled constantly.
The councillors who had participated in the
conference over Druce&#8217;s case which had resulted
so happily were calling up to congratulate
Boland on the success of his maneuver.
Somehow these felicitations did not please him
as his fellow advisers had expected.
</p>
<p>His mood was gloomy. He could not shake
it off. Constantly the same question returned
to his mind he had won, yes, but what difference
did it make? Was he any happier? Was
the world any better? Boland had never been
worried by questions of this sort before. He
could not answer them.
</p>
<p>He was still in this gray mood when the
guardian of his door announced the arrival of
Grogan. Michael Grogan was, perhaps, Boland&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
most intimate friend. He had not
taken Grogan into his confidence when he
planned his coup to release Druce. He felt
that Grogan would not be in sympathy with
his campaign for destroying the work of the
reformers. Still he was glad to see Grogan.
After all he was a friend. And this morning
John Boland, for the first time, perhaps, in
his life, felt the need of a friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; said Grogan taking a seat, &#8220;I see
you&#8217;ve &#8216;sprung&#8217; Druce?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? Mike you&#8217;re an inveterate reader of
the newspapers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re yelling about it this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them yell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well Mike, I&#8217;m a modest man. I had
something to do with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten business!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said it was a rotten business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The commercial interests of the city demanded
it. Do you think I will stand idly by
and see a bunch of half-baked reformers shake
down the business institutions of Chicago?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;John, they are right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O yes, I suppose if you take the mamby-pamby,
hysterical, sentimental end of it, any
campaign that hits at vice is right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great movement. Mary Randall
is a fine girl. You&#8217;ll live to regret that you
helped to thwart her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw, what&#8217;s the matter with you, man?
You&#8217;re blood seems to be turning to milk.
The papers will howl for a few days and then
they&#8217;ll forget it. We&#8217;ll invite them to. We&#8217;ll
suggest that if they don&#8217;t forget it the interests
we represent may feel called upon to cut
down their advertising. They&#8217;ll forget it all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, John,&#8221; Grogan spoke deliberately.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t kill off a great and righteous movement
by choking a few newspapers. The
newspapers are powerful but their power has
its limits. That girl has built a fire under this
town that will rage in spite of you or me, or
any one else. We can&#8217;t stop it.&#8221; Grogan rose.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I just dropped in to let
you know how I feel about it. I thought I
might be able to persuade you to get out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
this fight. I guess, John, you&#8217;re incorrigible.
Well, no hard feelings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland laughed. &#8220;Have a drink as you go
out. You need something to cheer you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan stopped. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Harry?&#8221; he
asked suddenly.
</p>
<p>Boland flushed and his brow darkened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;He and I
have had a misunderstanding. He insists on
marrying this Welcome girl. I don&#8217;t know
where he is and I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grogan looked surprised. &#8220;John,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;d feel sorry for you if I didn&#8217;t know you are
lying. You do care. You can&#8217;t conceal it.
You care now, and worse you&#8217;ll be caring more
and more as time goes on. John, there are
some things even you can&#8217;t do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mike, what are they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t beat Nature and you can&#8217;t beat
God. Good day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In vain Boland scoffed at Grogan&#8217;s sentimentalism.
Again and again the words rose
in his mind:
</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t beat Nature and you can&#8217;t beat
God.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>The telephone rang. At the other end of
the wire was that senator who had been at his
conference. He asked Boland in a frightened
voice if he had seen the papers, and then rang
off.
</p>
<p>Boland, alarmed, sent a boy in haste for the
latest editions. The boy returned and spread
them out on the desk before him.
</p>
<p>Again the telephone rang. This time it was
the clergyman who had participated in the conference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that Mary Randall is out in
a statement that she knows full details of what
she calls the plot that resulted in the liberation
of Martin Druce?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;She
says she will give the whole thing to the newspapers
later. They are calling it in the streets
below my study window now. Can&#8217;t something
be done to head off that statement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you suggest? Why don&#8217;t you
see some of the editors?&#8221; Boland returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s impossible. My dear Boland,
think of me. If my name should be published
in this connection my reputation would be
ruined.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>Boland laughed savagely into the telephone
and hung up the receiver, only to lift it again
and hear another appeal for help, this from
the publisher. He also feared ruin.
</p>
<p>Another call. The politician whose power
in a great political party was a by-word was
barking at the other end of the wire. He
accused Boland of destroying him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve destroyed us,&#8221; he yelped. &#8220;We&#8217;re
ruined. You&#8217;ve blundered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boland was beyond speech by this time.
He seized his hat and rushed out into the street.
Everywhere boys were shouting the extras.
Several people who recognized him as he
passed paused to look after him curiously. He
walked directly to his club.
</p>
<p>A few men gathered there reading newspapers
paused to look after him curiously,
bowed coldly and at once resumed reading.
Others seemed to avoid him. Boland felt that
the newspapers&#8217; conspicuous comment on a certain
financial magnate prominent in the electrical
world in connection with the vice-scandal
pointed at him too plainly for any one in Chicago
to misunderstand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>He called his car and drove to his lonely
home.
</p>
<p>That night John Boland had a strange
vision. He saw an eternity of pain and everlasting
darkness. Through it the nightmare
of his past life in strangely terrifying pictures
passed before his mind.
</p>
<p>Scenes of his boyhood, the panorama of his
young manhood, pictures of his battle for success
against overwhelming forces in the great
city. These pictures returned again and
again, vivid in their relief. He saw again the
death of his wife and the spirit of darkness
that had then come to walk beside him, taunting
him that now he was of necessity a cold,
calculating, lonely, indomitable man, not
knowing how to give to his only son fatherly
tenderness.
</p>
<p>This phase passed. He seemed to enter into
a larger world full of terrifying monsters, all
of human form. One he recognized as Druce,
another as Anson, a third as the senator whose
seat he had helped to get. And with them
came a host of smaller figures, some struggling
for life, and being crushed down into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
oblivion under his inexorable progress, some
fighting with one another lest they too be
torn down and crushed before him.
</p>
<p>There were piteous girl faces and worn
kindly faces of women and men and these had
gone down before the others because they
had not the power of resistance needed in this
battle. It was a great whirling nightmare
of continuous struggle.
</p>
<p>And always walking by his side and seeming
to grow stronger and more terrible as he
tore his path through every obstacle strode his
guide, the spirit of darkness.
</p>
<p>At last they were alone, he and the spirit.
And the spirit turned upon him and clutched
him by the throat. He struggled in that grasp
just as others had struggled in his own grasp,
tortured and futile. And again those words
from Grogan:
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;You can&#8217;t beat Nature and you can&#8217;t beat
God!&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p>Sweat stood out on John Boland&#8217;s forehead.
</p>
<p>He awoke with a mighty effort and sat
upright. Around him was the emptiness and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
loneliness of the great bed-chamber. He saw
with eyes wide open and brain alert a picture
that looked like a reality and not a vision.
</p>
<p>It was of a trembling man bent with age
and loneliness.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE CALL OF ETERNITY</h3>
</div>

<p>Elsie walked on and on eastward towards
the lake. For a week she had been living
alone in a room she had found near the
park on the night that she left Harvey Spencer,
telephoning in the drug-store. She had
resolved that instant to go. It was to be &#8220;Now
or never&#8221;&mdash;and she hurried away in an opposite
direction from the hiding place&mdash;and from
Druce.
</p>
<p>The little money that he had put in her
hands for drugs had somehow lasted her until
now. She had been too ill to go out, her body
racked with fever.
</p>
<p>She was conscious that she must tomorrow
find some work to do, for the landlady had
twice asked her for the next week&#8217;s rent. She
looked in at the door of a laundry where a
German woman was singing as she ironed
children&#8217;s dresses by the light of a flaring gas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
jet. It looked pleasant and peaceful in there.
Perhaps that motherly woman would let her
work with her. She would see tomorrow.
</p>
<p>Elsie walked on towards the lake. She
wanted to look at the water. She wanted to
breathe the cool breath of great winds coming
over the water to cool this fierce fire of shame
and horror fevering her soul, flaming in her
delicate cheeks.
</p>
<p>Elsie came to the lake front at a wide high
lot between two comfortable mansions on
Sheridan Road.
</p>
<p>Lights of homes shone through the night&#8217;s
darkness. Beams as of sunshine danced across
the water.
</p>
<p>A light from an upper chamber in the nearest
home shone across her and streamed
onward to the sands.
</p>
<p>Elsie stood clasping and unclasping her little
slender hands. The waters,&mdash;they could
wash away that blow, the marks of that blow,
wash away those words threatening death
from one who had killed something in her
heart. She realized that she was not afraid,
facing the life to come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>She was afraid only to go on living in the
same world with one who had taken her girlhood
and her womanhood, afraid only of this
frightful fever in her veins, of this poison that
was consuming her.
</p>
<p>Out yonder were the cool deeps of death&mdash;of
death? What then? Far across the waves
she saw a light.
</p>
<p>It was as if her spirit went to meet the light,
went in quest of the meaning of such a beacon
light across black waters.
</p>
<p>The light seemed to grow bigger and bigger
as she gazed. By flinging her frail body into
the dreadful surges could one reach peace and
safety?
</p>
<p>Faintly her spirit heard the answer of the
pursuing hound of heaven, faintly she heard
the call of eternity and of the Eternal Love.
</p>
<p>The great black billows called to her. Elsie
wondered what all the poor girls the waves
toss up along the shores say to their Maker.
She seemed to feel with them as she stood
there, how the waves seize the bodies of the
lost,&mdash;how the undertow takes them. Elsie
put her hands to her face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I here alone in the night?&#8221; she
heard herself asking. Her voice sounded
strangely familiar, yet unfamiliar as if some
one were speaking to her. Then she knew
that the voice was her own soul in the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother will forgive me, mother wants me
back, mother will help me get well&mdash;if there is
any health in me. Mother knows that it
wasn&#8217;t all my fault&mdash;&#8221; her thought defended
her against that voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I here alone in the night?&#8221; the
question was repeated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go home. I will begin again. Men
begin again. Oh!...&#8221; A sob came from
her lips.... &#8220;No, no, no!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt with every nerve of her quivering
being that in the slow upward climb of sex
towards true love and true parenthood
woman&#8217;s battle is man&#8217;s,&mdash;felt that God and
Nature are now demanding not less of men.
</p>
<p>The suffering girl could not put her certainty
into words, but in her body and in her
soul she knew&mdash;she knew.
</p>
<p>Suddenly from the opened window of the
nearest home she heard above the wind the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
cry of a baby, the loud, sweet, prolonged,
fiercely-demanding cry of a hungry little
baby.
</p>
<p>A wistful smile twisted her lips as she
listened.
</p>
<p>Suddenly as the baby&#8217;s cry was stopped she
put her hands to her bosom and a strange
lovely light shone on her face.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>AT THE WEDDING FEAST</h3>
</div>

<p>Brightly shone the sunshine on the
fields and woods surrounding Millville
and on the little house where Mrs. Welcome
was busy putting the last touches to the order
and sweetness of home.
</p>
<p>Patience and her husband were coming on
the noon train.
</p>
<p>Later in the day a few of their friends had
promised to come to the supper for which
her mother had been making loaves of delicious
cake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange, strange that my child should
be the wife of John Boland&#8217;s son,&#8221; she mused.
&#8220;I wonder what my poor man would say.
Would he feel less bitter if he could know that
Boland sent me all that money, with that letter
&#8216;as justice to Tom Welcome&#8217;s widow?&#8217;
Patience and Harry are so happy now it
makes me feel like wanting to forget the past.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
If only I could know where my baby girl is.
But I just must go on trusting. Somehow
I feel hopeful. Patience and Harry want me
to be brave. Harry&#8217;s father&mdash;he must find
it hard to be brave too. He must be lonesome,
estranged from his son, no one to comfort him.
Perhaps he sent me that money really as a sign
to Harry that he wants to be friends again.
I won&#8217;t say anything to Harry about it just
yet, but maybe some of these days....&#8221;
The direct train of her thought was interrupted
by the sound of a bird singing on the
bough of a tree close by the opened window.
</p>
<p>She stepped out into the side porch and
looked about her with a glance of pleasure in
the neatness and charm of the little place.
House and fence had been painted and
mended, put in tidy order. A new gate and a
cement sidewalk in front running down to
the corner of the street spoke for the industry
of Harvey Spencer who had worked like a
son for her in his spare hours.
</p>
<p>The song of the bird in the elm bough had
dropped to a happy twittering. The fragrance
of late garden blossoms filled the air.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
At the end of the deep yard, beyond the vegetable
garden and close to the back gate Harvey
had built a pretty summer house and over it
a madeira vine hung its abundant quick growing
wreaths of green.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome in her light summer dress,
her gray hair moved a trifle by the soft warm
breeze, walked slowly down the garden path
and sat down for a few moments of rest in
this quiet spot. A sudden sadness came upon
her face as almost always these months since
her home coming when she rested from her
working.
</p>
<p>But she rose resolutely and banished the
thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is my oldest daughter&#8217;s day. I must
think of nobody but Patience and make her
coming home with her husband as glad as can
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke aloud, to make her resolution
stronger and walked back towards the house,
gathering nasturtiums and asparagus as she
went, to decorate the fresh and pretty parlor,
with its new white muslin curtains and wall
paper and the piano which Harry Boland had
sent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly lovely, mother,&#8221; Patience
was saying to her in this room within the
hour, Patience whom everybody in Millville
loved, standing radiant and happy beside her
equally radiant bridegroom. &#8220;How did you
ever get those flowers to trail over that picture
as if they just grew there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a great success as a decorator, and
we can&#8217;t begin to thank you enough,&#8221; said
Harry Boland. &#8220;I think Patience and I are
in great luck that we can make our home with
you. It&#8217;s all settled that I&#8217;m to have that office
opposite the court-house, going to buy and sell
real estate and work up a regular business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and mother, Harry finds that a whole
lot of these cottages the mill people live
in are really his own, from his mother&#8217;s estate
directly to him. He&#8217;s going to put them all
in decent order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember Michael Grogan? He
is going to help us do things in Millville. He
has promised to build us a club house and
dance hall, a social center for the mill young
people if you and Patience will help run it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Young folks need their fun,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
responded Mrs. Welcome heartily. &#8220;Come
along, Patey dear, and see the cakes mother
has been baking for you and Harry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mary Randall and Michael Grogan,
Harvey Spencer and his sister and brother-in-law
were the five guests who assembled in the
late afternoon to honor the home-coming of
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Boland.
</p>
<p>Michael Grogan came first, arriving in a
carriage of the hack type from the station. He
brought a huge bouquet of roses for the bride
and a case of grape-juice for the cheer of the
festivity.
</p>
<p>At supper he proposed the health of the
young pair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May they always live happy ever after,&#8221;
said Grogan, standing up, glass in hand.
&#8220;May they never have any troubles that they
can&#8217;t nip in the bud. As their principles demand
of &#8217;em to drink this stuff as the pure
juice of the grape, may it be blessed to &#8217;em
forever and to their descendants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every body laughed and drank. Harry
Boland toasted him in return:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the health of our very good friend,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
Mr. Michael Grogan. May all his mornings
be golden and all his sunsets clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the sunrises in particular,&#8221;
said Grogan. &#8220;Now ladies and gentlemen I
wish to toast the good health of another young
lady who is with us today, one who has made
me a great deal of trouble and scared me blue
with blue envelopes. May she soon find a
bridegroom for herself, one of them brave
lads who can talk right back to her as I never
could when she tackled this old man!&#8221; He
lifted his grape-juice with a great flourish.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s to herself, Miss Mary Randall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Randall blushed and nodded her
thanks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speech, speech,&#8221; demanded Grogan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you but I just can&#8217;t, not
here, not now,&#8221; she said and quiet fell upon
them.
</p>
<p>The thoughts of all were with the young
girl who had disappeared, for whom all had
worked, suffered, prayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do want to say,&#8221; Miss Randall, broke the
silence, &#8220;that you all must know how glad I
am that Mr. and Mrs. Harry Boland are to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
have a useful and happy life together and that
I....&#8221; She stopped suddenly, looking out
the opened door that led towards the garden,
her whole expression changing, her lips parting,
her breath coming quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you see out there?&#8221; asked Harvey
Spencer, with the sharp intentness which
he had learned from his maturing city experience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now constable, don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221; chaffed
Grogan, to whose aid Harvey&#8217;s quick rise to
prominence and office was in part due. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want to be catching any burglars this
happy day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Patience Boland, rising.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, to be really certain.&#8221;
Mary looked at Mrs. Welcome. &#8220;Somebody
came in at the back gate and went into the
summer-house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Welcome leaned heavily on the table.
</p>
<p>Harvey ran to the window. Grogan looked
over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Randall, please go out and see.&#8221;
Patience&#8217;s arms were already about her
mother. &#8220;Mumsey, mumsey, can it be?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>Mary went out into the porch and down the
garden path.
</p>
<p>It was Elsie Welcome who came out of the
summer-house and slowly along between the
flower borders. She was shockingly emaciated.
She stopped and put her suit case down on
the ground; its weight seemed too great for
her spent strength.
</p>
<p>Mary ran to her.
</p>
<p>Elsie looked at her with sorrowful dark
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid to go in,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear people in there talking and laughing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all friends of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my mother&mdash;will my mother...?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, your mother&#8217;s heart is breaking for
the sight of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie ran forward to the doorway of the
familiar room. A step forward. Mother and
daughter stood in a tender embrace.
</p>
<p>The mother&#8217;s face was radiant with great
warmth of love. Patience rushed to her sister
and clasped her close.
</p>
<p>Michael Grogan had led a tiptoe retreat of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
the visitors leaving mother and daughters
alone, but Patience called them back.
</p>
<p>Elsie, smiling wanly, slipped like a little
wraith across and into a chair beside her
mother, and felt that dear hand clasping hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so good to be here with you,&#8221; she whispered,
looking vaguely about at the others,
then a dreadful fit of coughing seized her and
she sank exhausted in her mother&#8217;s arms.
</p>
<p>Harvey helped carry her into the little room
off the parlor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear little thing, all you need is lots of
fresh eggs and your ma&#8217;s nursing to set you
up again,&#8221; he said to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Harvey, she is feeling very ill now,
but we will all help her get well,&#8221; said Patience,
as they went out of the room together,
leaving Elsie to rest in her mother&#8217;s care.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>WITH THE ROSES OF LOVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Welcome came into the little
bedroom very quietly one afternoon
about a week later, in her hands a large glass
bowl overflowing with roses.
</p>
<p>She put it down on the table beside the bed
and stood looking wistfully at the small dark
head on the pillow.
</p>
<p>Elsie felt her there, opened her eyes and
smiled as she saw the flowers. A deeper color
burned for a moment in her cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Harvey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a dear,
mamma?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He always thought the world and all of
you,&#8221; Mrs. Welcome sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always liked him, but I never did love
him, you know. I just let him come to see
me because he wanted to, and all the girls had
company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have loved him dearie if&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t gone away, you mean, but I
did go away.&#8221; Elsie coughed violently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, sweet, don&#8217;t.&#8221; Her mother
helped her to sit up and held her in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvey comes every day to ask how you
are,&#8221; said Mrs. Welcome when she was better.
&#8220;He wants to see you when you feel
able.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie remained silent.
</p>
<p>Out in the parlor they could hear Patience
moving about, putting things in order, singing
as she worked one of the songs she and
Elsie used to sing when they were little girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Mrs. Boland is some singer,&#8221; said
Elsie with a flash of her old fun. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice
for our Patey to be so happy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She and I want you to be happy too, and
you will when you get well, my precious. You
will laugh and sing as you used to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, I see through you,&#8221; said Elsie.
&#8220;I bet Harvey is here now. He brought these
roses himself. He coaxed you to coax me to
see him. All right. Shake up my pillows.
Get Patey&#8217;s pink boudoir cap and put your
pink shawl around me and bring him in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>Her pallor was more marked by the bright
cap and shawl and the flame in her cheeks
seemed scarlet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Harvey,&#8221; she greeted him almost in
her old bright voice. &#8220;Thank you for the roses.
They&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A violent coughing made it impossible for
Elsie to finish speaking.
</p>
<p>He came and stood beside her and took her
hot little outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so pretty and I&#8217;m so glad you let
me come in,&#8221; he said gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Harvey, I&#8217;m the one that&#8217;s glad,&#8221; said
Elsie, trying to speak brightly. She laid back
on the pillow. The effort to talk exhausted
her.
</p>
<p>Harvey knelt down beside the bed so that
his face was almost on a level with hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to get tired, dear,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I just want you to rest and get well.
Rest now!&#8221; He put his hand tenderly on
her hot forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How cool your hand feels,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Put it over my eyes. They burn so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He obeyed her and they remained quiet for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
many minutes; through their hearts went
many thoughts.
</p>
<p>She moved slightly. He understood, removed
his hand and waited.
</p>
<p>When Elsie opened her eyes she looked
directly into his kind eyes filled with grief and
love.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be so sorry for me, Harvey,&#8221;
she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be better soon, and then&mdash;remember,
little dear, I still have the wedding
ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elsie sighed. &#8220;Poor old Harvey! There
never was anybody so good as you are to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She patted his cheek. &#8220;It&#8217;s so good of you
to go on caring about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stop if I wanted to,&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
want to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put her thin arm about his neck. &#8220;Will
you do something for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything on earth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A wan little funny gleam lighted her pretty
dark eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is on earth, all right. I&#8217;ll tell you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
about it next time you come....&#8221; Suddenly
Elsie sat up and grasped him. &#8220;There
will be a next time, won&#8217;t there, Harvey?&#8221; she
asked him in a wild tone, a wave of terror seeming
to go over her.
</p>
<p>He held her gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, dear. Of course there
is going to be a next time ... all the rest
of our lives. You didn&#8217;t think even for a minute
that I would go back on you, did you,
Elsie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled and released herself, then smiled
again. &#8220;No, no, I didn&#8217;t mean that. Take a
chair, Harvey, and tell me about the weather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harvey took the chair and once more possessed
himself of her hand.
</p>
<p>She smiled sweetly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let me ask you a favor. Let&#8217;s name
the day, Elsie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Promise to marry
me,&mdash;as soon as you get well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When&mdash;I&mdash;get&mdash;well,&#8221; Elsie looked wonderingly
at him. She saw his passionate earnestness,
his need of hope. Hope! It was fast
fainting in her heart. &#8220;Yes, Harvey,&mdash;when
I get well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>He bent over her and with deep tenderness
kissed her.
</p>
<p>Violent coughing seized her. It was the
worst, the most prolonged Elsie had yet had.
One spasm followed another, bringing her
mother with remedies.
</p>
<p>Harvey moved frantically about; he was
the first to suggest the doctor and ran out to
bring one. He did not realize, he could not
know what had really happened.
</p>
<p>When he returned Elsie had fallen asleep
and the physician advised them not to waken
her, promising to call early in the morning.
The faithful Harvey went with him. He had
her answer, &#8220;when I get well,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Elsie remained until nearly day-break in a
very deep sleep. The fever left her during this
long repose. Her sister, who was watching
beside her, thought she was better because her
forehead grew damp and cool.
</p>
<p>With the first early light of morning Elsie
opened her eyes.
</p>
<p>Patience pushed back the pretty tendrils of
her dark hair. &#8220;It&#8217;s sister watching with you,
dear,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s mother?&#8221; murmured Elsie in a
voice so weak that it frightened Patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother! mother! Please come!&#8221; she called.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming,&#8221; answered Patience as Mrs.
Welcome came hurrying to the bedside.
</p>
<p>She understood without a word, lifting
Elsie in her arms, the frail little worn body
against her heart. Tears streamed down her
face; sobs shook her body.
</p>
<p>Patience hurried weeping to summon
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Mother,&#8221; moaned Elsie. &#8220;I am
so glad I am home with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Elsie, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have come long ago, but I didn&#8217;t
dare&mdash;so many girls never dare go home.
Some of their mothers don&#8217;t want them, but
you&mdash;. Mother&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes my darling, yes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid, so afraid. I went&mdash;and&mdash;looked&mdash;at
the&mdash;lake.&#8221; She seemed to her
mother to wander a bit.
</p>
<p>Her breathing became difficult. No more
words came. A few quick fluttering breaths&mdash;Elsie
was gone.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>AT MARY RANDALL&#8217;S SUMMER HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>Lake Geneva season was at its close.
Most of the lake dwellers had closed their
houses and returned to town. For those who
remained late autumn had her glories. Woods
and groves were gay in foliage. Orchards
bowed their heads beneath their loads of ripened
fruit. In shorn fields the birds, preparing
for southern migration, sang of a year
crowned with plenty.
</p>
<p>Vines hung deep about the broad veranda of
the villa where Mary Randall was resting from
her labors in the company of her uncle and
aunt. She sat alone in a corner of the veranda
one sunny day, waiting for the arrival of the
journalist Ambrose, one of her most efficient
aids.
</p>
<p>Anna, her faithful maid came with an armful
of flowers and began arranging them
on the table.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You love those old-fashioned flowers even
more than I do, I believe, Anna,&#8221; said Miss
Randall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do love them. They seem like the blossom
of my vacation,&#8221; said Anna.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty way to put it. Your vacation
is to be a good long one. You have certainly
earned it. You&#8217;re as worn as I am, after
our battle. I never should have got through
it without you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Mary. Here comes the
flower of all your workers,&mdash;Mr. Ambrose,&#8221;
said the girl, and withdrew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; said the journalist cheerfully,
coming to greet his friend, and noting with a
sudden swift pleasure that a faint blush came
to her cheeks and a new light to her eyes as
she welcomed him. &#8220;Good news! As I was
coming away the newspapers were out with
the extra. The city council held a special
meeting during the afternoon. They have
abolished the segregated district. The city has
formally adopted the policy of suppressing
instead of circumscribing vice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the beginning of the end,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
Miss Randall. &#8220;If our campaign has won that
we have won all I hoped for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet many people believe that we failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we had failed we should have
made progress. Every movement of this kind
leaves its mark on the public conscience. It
makes work easier for other crusaders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded Ambrose, &#8220;because it
brings out the facts. Facts are lasting. They
cannot die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Progress comes through inculcation of
these facts, by means of education. Schools
and churches&mdash;and parents&mdash;must concentrate
on the moral improvement of the rising generation,
or we wrestle ineffectively.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of vice you have been specially
fighting will be extinct within the next ten
years,&#8221; said Ambrose. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that we
shall have suppressed vice. That is a task for
centuries. But our people in the United States
will not stand for this trade in girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to preach to men who have daughters
to protect to take their wives and go out
and see some of the shady places of the city
for themselves. It would make any mother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
far more careful in future about the companions
of their daughters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to whisper about &#8216;wild oats&#8217; and to
see a young man who wants to marry one&#8217;s
daughter in a dive are two very different
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have vice,&#8221; said Miss
Randall, &#8220;as long as economic conditions set
the stage for it. A young girl housed in a
poor tenement, ill-lighted, poorly heated, badly
ventilated, fed and clothed insufficiently&mdash;see
to it that she hears foul language, and witnesses
drunkenness and quarrelling&mdash;then
you have the condition that produces the delinquent
city girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are attacking all those evils,&#8221; said Ambrose.
&#8220;The public conscience is rising against
them. I predict the time when it will be regarded
as great a disgrace for a city to possess
a &#8216;back of the yards,&#8217; a ghetto or a slum tenement
district as it is now to have a district
organized for the exploitation of women. It&#8217;s
coming. You and I shall see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mary Randall had risen, deeply moved
while he spoke. She leaned against the trellis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
and gazed far across the silver-shot lake at the
sun sinking, a great ball of crimson fire among
the dark trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God speed the day!&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Beyond the veranda in a darkened drawing-room
Mary Randall&#8217;s aunt had been resting
and had heard this conversation. She rose and
went softly away and out to a pergola where
she found her husband smoking a cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucius,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That young newspaper
man who has been out here to see Mary
is here again. They are talking in the veranda,
settling all the problems of Chicago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucius Randall blew a cloud of smoke.
&#8220;Well, my dear, that is the only way this old
world gets ahead, for each generation to tackle
its problems anew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that young man likes Mary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Many young men do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I really believe Mary likes him.
She talks to him with a sweet note in her voice,
even when they are discussing the most impossible
subjects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; said Lucius Randall
with much serenity.

<h3>AFTERWORD</h3>
</div>

<p>In our modern crusade against that most
ancient evil known as the white slave traffic
we have made at least one serious advance.
All over the world that conspiracy of silence
which has fettered thought and prevented
open action in the fight is ended.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, as Havelock Ellis, author of
the famous &#8220;Psychology of Sex,&#8221; says in the
<i>Metropolitan</i> discussion of this subject,
&#8220;churches, societies, journalist, legislators,
have all joined the ranks of the agitators. Not
only has there been no voice on the opposite
side, which was scarcely to be expected&mdash;for
there has never been any anxiety to cry aloud
in defense of &#8216;white slavery&#8217; from the housetops&mdash;but
there has been a new and noteworthy
conquest over indifference and over
that sacred silence which was supposed to encompass
all sexual topics with suitable darkness.
The banishment of that silence in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
cause of social hygiene is, indeed, not the least
significant feature of this agitation. * * *
</p>
<p>&#8220;By insuring that our workers, and especially
our women workers, are decently paid, so that
they can live comfortably on their wages, we
shall not, indeed, have abolished prostitution,
which is more than an economic phenomenon,
but we shall more effectually check the white
slave trader than by the most Draconic legislation
the most imaginative vice crusader ever
devised. And when we insure that these same
workers have ample time and opportunity for
free and joyous recreation we shall have done
more to kill the fascination of the white slave
traffic than by endless police regulations for
the moral supervision of the young.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt the element of human nature in
the manifestations we are concerned with will
still be at work, an obscure instinct often
acting differently in each sex, but tending to
drive both into the same risks. Here we need
even more fundamental social changes. It is
sheer foolishness to suppose that when we
raise our little dams in the path of a great
stream of human impulse that stream will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
forthwith flow calmly back to its source. We
must make our new channels concurrently with
our dams. We can at least begin today a task
of education which must slowly though surely
undermine the white slave trader&#8217;s stronghold.
Such an education needs to be not merely instruction
in the facts of sex and wise guidance
concerning all the dangers and risks of the
sexual life; it must also involve a training of
the will, a development of the sense of responsibility,
such as can never be secured by shutting
our young people up in a hothouse,
sheltered from every fortifying breath of the
outside world.&#8221;

<p>It was in Illinois that Abraham Lincoln&mdash;a
Southerner, Kentucky born&mdash;threw down
the gage in his famous Bloomington speech
in the matter of buying and selling human beings
as slaves. It is in Illinois&mdash;in spite of
much disgrace which the State&#8217;s fair name
has had forced upon it&mdash;that men and women
have enlisted for life to fight in the battle
against buying and selling white girls, to fight
against that special dealing in &#8220;live stock&#8221;
actually known to have gone on for years,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
which is Chicago&#8217;s special shame as a distributing
center.
</p>
<p>There is eternal shouting and exhorting
against the immorality and vice of the levee,
but I wonder if it isn&#8217;t society&#8217;s hue and cry
to divert attention from viciousness in what
are called &#8220;the best circles,&#8221; a condition that is
a hundred times more important.
</p>
<p>Will the churches be in some measure convinced
that they must organize for a combined
effort to save the children of today&mdash;that souls
are more important than sectarianism, and
that Sunday is not the only day in the week?
</p>
<p>If every unmarried woman with money and
time at her disposal were to devote part of her
leisure to the care of one child there would be
far less misery in the slums and many a little
sister would be saved.
</p>
<p>If there is to be any effective reform we
must arouse society from its lethargic viewpoint
too generally accepted that the devil is
never so black as he is painted.
</p>
<p>As long as mothers do not know who the
young men are with whom their daughters
spend evenings away from home so long will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
there be the troop of Little Lost Sisters tripping,
stumbling down the trail that leads hellward.
</p>
<p>Let us make the war against commercialized
vice a bigger thing than a presidential campaign,
bigger than any war, bigger than anything
that was ever known in a woman&#8217;s movement
before in the world!
